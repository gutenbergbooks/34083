<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>When we go back to the early history of any people,
we find that fact and fiction are strangely blended, and
that the stories told are largely made up of traditions
distorted and exaggerated by imagination and time. The
myth, however, is valuable as representing the first steps
of a nation in the evolution of its literature from a barbaric
state, and as indicating special national characteristics.</p>

<p>The myths of Greece, for example, are chiefly derived
from the traditions extant when the alphabet was
invented, and are preserved in the poetic stories of
Homer and Virgil. Combined, they make that mythology
which grew up in Greece, and which now so largely
permeates the literature of every civilized language.</p>

<p>The first stories given in this book are myths. They
stand first in the order of precedence because they stand
first in the order of time.</p>

<p>The myths are followed by a few parables and fables,
forms of stories which from the earliest times have been
used to apply some well-established principle of morals
to practical conduct.</p>

<p>Next follow legends, where we are called upon to separate
the probable from the improbable, the true from
the false. Herodotus, the father of history, wrote his
account of the "Persian Empire" several hundred years
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
after the events took place which he has recorded. The
stories had been preserved to his day by tradition.</p>

<p>In the traditional stories and in the truer records
which follow, the pupil will see the play of the same
emotions and passions which actuate men at the present
time, and the careers of the great conquerors, Frederic
and Napoleon, differ little essentially from those of Alexander
and CÃ¦sar. Tyranny remains the same forever,
encroaching upon human liberty and limiting the field of
human conduct. It will be seen also that from the state
of barbarism there has been a gradual evolution which
more and more places men under the protection of equal
laws.</p>

<p>These books are to be used mainly for the stories they
contain. By a simple reproduction in speech or in writing,
we have the best possible language lesson. The value
of the books may be entirely lost by catechisms which
demand the literal reproduction of the text.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b><i>I.&mdash;ARION.</i></b></p>

<p>1. Arion was a famous
musician, and dwelt at the
court of Periander, King of
Corinth, with whom he was
a great favorite. There was a
musical contest in Sicily, and
Arion longed to compete for the
prize. He told his wish to Periander, who besought him
like a brother to give up the thought. "Pray stay with
me," he said, "and be contented. He who strives to win
may lose." Arion answered: "A wandering life best suits
the free heart of a poet. A talent which a god bestowed
upon me I would fain make a source of pleasure to others;
and if I win the prize, how will the enjoyment of it be
increased by the consciousness of my wide-spread fame!"</p>

<p>2. He went, won the prize, and embarked with his
wealth in a Corinthian vessel for home. On the second
morning after setting sail, the wind breathed mild and
fair. "O Periander!" he exclaimed, "dismiss your
fears. Soon shall you forget them in my embrace. With
what lavish offerings will we display our gratitude to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
gods, and how merry will we be at the festal board!"
The wind and sea continued favorable, not a cloud
dimmed the firmament. He had not trusted too much to
the ocean, but to man he had. He overheard the seamen
plotting to get possession of his treasure. Presently they
surrounded him, loud and mutinous, and said: "Arion,
you must die! If you would have a grave on the shore,
yield yourself to die on this spot; but if otherwise, cast
yourself into the sea."</p>

<p>3. "Will nothing satisfy you but my life?" said he;
"take my gold in welcome. I willingly buy my life at
that price." "No, no; we can not spare you. Your life
would be too dangerous to us. Where could we go to
escape Periander if he should know that you had been
robbed by us? Your gold would be of little use to us, if,
on returning home, we could never more be free from
fear." "Grant me, then," said he, "a last request, since
naught will prevail to save my life, that I may die as I
have lived, as becomes a bard. When I shall have sung
my death-song, and my harp-strings cease to vibrate, then
I will bid farewell to life, and yield to my fate." This
prayer, like the others, would have been unheeded&mdash;they
thought only of their booty&mdash;but to hear so famous a
musician moved their hearts. "Suffer me," he added,
"to arrange my dress. Apollo will not favor me unless
I am clad in my minstrel garb."</p>

<p>4. He clothed himself in gold and purple, fair to see,
his tunic fell around him in graceful folds, jewels adorned
his arms, his brow was crowned with a golden wreath, and
over his neck and shoulders flowed his hair, perfumed
with odors. His left hand held the lyre, his right the
ivory wand with which he struck the chords. Like one
inspired he seemed to drink the morning air and glitter
in the morning ray. The seamen gazed in admiration.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
He strode forward to the vessel's side, and looked down
into the blue sea.</p>

<p>5. Addressing his lyre, he sang: "Companion of my
voice, come with me to the realm of shades! Though
Cerberus may growl, we know the power of song can
tame his rage. Ye heroes of Elysium, who have passed
the darkling flood&mdash;ye happy souls, soon shall I join your
band. Yet can ye relieve my grief? Alas! I leave my
friend behind me. Thou, who didst find thy Eurydice,
and lose her again as soon as found, when she had vanished
like a dream, how thou didst hate the cheerful
light! I must away, but I will not fear. The gods look
down upon us. Ye who slay me unoffending, when I
am no more your time of trembling shall come! Ye
Nereids, receive your guest, who throws himself upon
your mercy!" So saying, he sprang into the deep sea.
The waves covered him, and the seamen held their way,
fancying themselves safe from all danger of detection.</p>

<p>6. But the strains of his music had drawn around him
the inhabitants of the deep to listen, and dolphins followed
the ship as if charmed by a spell. While he struggled
in the waves a dolphin offered him its back, and
carried him mounted thereon safe to shore. At the
spot where he landed, a monument of brass was afterward
erected upon the rocky shore to preserve the memory of
the event.</p>

<p>7. When Arion and the dolphin parted, each returning
to his own element, Arion thus poured forth his thanks:
"Farewell, thou faithful, friendly fish! Would that I
could reward thee! but thou canst not wend with me, nor I
with thee; companionship we may not have. May Galatea,
queen of the deep, accord thee her favor, and thou,
proud of the burden, draw her chariot over the smooth
mirror of the deep!"</p>

    8. Arion hastened from the shore, and soon saw before
him the towers of Corinth. He journeyed on, harp in
hand, singing as he went, full of love and happiness, forgetting
his losses, and mindful only of what remained, his
friend and his lyre. He entered the hospitable halls, and
was soon clasped in the embrace of Periander. "I come
back to thee, my friend," he said. "The talent which a
god bestowed has been the delight of thousands, but false
knaves have stripped me of my well-earned treasure."
Then he told all the wonderful events that had befallen
him. Periander, who heard him in amazement, said:
"Shall such wickedness triumph? Then in vain is
power lodged in my hands. That we may discover the
criminals you must lie here concealed, so that they come
without suspicion."</p>

<p>9. When the ship arrived in the harbor, he summoned
the mariners before him. "Have you heard anything
of Arion?" he inquired. "I anxiously look for his return."
They replied, "We left him well and prosperous
in Tarentum." As they said these words, Arion stepped
forth and faced them. He was clad in all his glory as
when he leaped into the sea. They fell prostrate at his
feet, as if a lightning-bolt had struck them. "We meant
to murder him, and he has become a god! O earth, open
and receive us!" Then Periander spoke: "He lives,
the master of the lay! kind Heaven protects the poet's
life. As for you, I invoke not the spirit of vengeance;
Arion wishes not your blood. Ye slaves of avarice, begone!
Seek some barbarous land, and never may aught
beautiful delight your souls!"</p>

<h2><i>II.&mdash;ARACHNE.</i></h2>

<p>1. In the old mythology it was considered a great
sin for any mortal to enter into a contest with a god, and
whenever one did so he incurred a fearful penalty. The
maiden Arachne early showed marvelous skill in embroidery
and all kinds of needle-work. So beautiful
were her designs that the nymphs themselves would leave
their groves and fountains, and come and gaze delighted
upon her work. It was not only beautiful when it was
done, but was beautiful in the doing. As they watched
the delicate touch of her fingers they declared that the
goddess Minerva must have been her teacher. This
Arachne denied, and, grown very vain of her many compliments,
she said: "Let Minerva try her skill with
mine, and if beaten I will pay the penalty!"</p>

<p>2. Minerva heard this, and was greatly displeased at
the vanity and presumption of the maiden. Assuming
the form of an old woman she went to Arachne and
gave her some friendly advice. "I have much experience,"
she said, "and I hope you will not despise my
counsel. Challenge mortals as much as you like, but do
not try and compete with a goddess!" Arachne stopped
her spinning, and angrily replied: "keep your counsel
for your daughters and handmaids; for my part, I know
what I say, and I stand to it. I am not afraid of the
goddess."</p>

<p>3. Minerva then dropped her disguise, and stood before
the company in her proper person. The nymphs
at once paid her homage. Arachne alone had no fear.
She stood by her resolve, and the contest proceeded. Each
took her station, and attached the web to the beam. Both
worked with speed; their skillful hands moved rapidly,
and the excitement of the contest made the labor light.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Minerva wrought into
her web the scene of her
contest with Neptune. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
gods are all represented in their most august forms, and
the picture is noble in its perfect simplicity and chaste
beauty. In the four corners she wrought scenes where
mortals entered into contest with gods and were punished
for their presumption. These were meant as warnings
to her rival to give up the contest before it was too late.</p>

<p>5. Arachne filled her web with subjects designedly
chosen to exhibit the failings and errors of the gods.
Every story to their discredit she appears to have treasured
up. The last scene she represented was that of
Jupiter in the form of a bull carrying off Europa across
the sea, leaving the heart-broken mother to wander in
search of her child until she died.</p>

<p>6. Minerva examined the work of her rival, and
doubly angry at the presumption and the sacrilege manifested
in her choice of subjects, struck her web with a
shuttle and tore it from the loom. She then touched the
forehead of Arachne and made her feel her guilt and
shame. This she could not endure, and went out and
hanged herself. Minerva pitied her, as she saw her
hanging by a rope. "Live, guilty woman," said she;
"and that you may preserve the memory of this lesson,
continue to hang, you and your descendants, to all future
times." She sprinkled her with the juice of aconite, and
immediately her form shrunk up, her head grew small,
and her fingers grew to her sides and served as legs. All
the rest of her is body, out of which she spins her
thread, often hanging suspended by it in the same attitude
as when Minerva touched her and transformed her
into a spider.</p>

<h2><i>III.&mdash;POLYPHEMUS.</i></h2>

<p>1. When Troy was captured, Ulysses, the King of Ithaca,
set sail for his native country. With favorable winds he
should have reached home in a few months, but he met
with so many adventures that it was ten years before he
saw the shores of his beloved Ithaca. At one time he
and his companions landed upon an unknown shore in
search of food. Ulysses took with him a jar of wine as
a present should he meet with any inhabitants. Presently
they came to a large cave, and entered it. There they
found lambs and kids in their pens, and a table spread
with cheese, fruits, and bowls of milk. But soon the
master of the cave, Polyphemus, returned, and Ulysses
saw that they were in the land of the Cyclops, a race of
immense giants. The name means "round eye," and
these giants were so called because they had but one eye,
and that was placed in the middle of the forehead.</p>

<p>2. Polyphemus drove into the cave the sheep and the
goats to be milked, and then placed a huge rock at the
mouth of the cave to serve as a door. While attending
to his supper he chanced to spy the Greeks, who were
hidden in one corner. He growled out to them, demanding
to know who they were, and where from. Ulysses
replied, stating that they were returning from the siege
of Troy, and that they had landed in search of provisions.
At this Polyphemus gave no answer, but seizing a couple
of Greeks, he killed and ate them up on the spot. He
then went to sleep, and his snoring sounded like thunder
in the ears of the terrified Greeks all the livelong night.
In the morning the giant arose, ate two more men, and
went out with his flocks, having carefully secured the
door so that the remainder could not get away.</p>

<p>3. Then Ulysses contrived a plan to punish the giant,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and get away from his clutches. He found a great bar
of wood which the giant had cut for a staff. This his
men sharpened at one end and hardened at the fire.
Then a number were selected to use it, and they awaited
events. In the evening Polyphemus returned, and having
eaten his two men he lay down to sleep. But Ulysses
presented him with some of the wine from the jar which
the giant eagerly drank, and called for more. In a short
time he was quite drunk, and then he asked Ulysses his
name, and he replied: "My name is Noman."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

    <p class="caption2"><i>Polyphemus.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. When the giant was fairly asleep, the sailors seized
the sharpened stick, and, aiming it directly at his single
eye, they rushed forward with all their might. The eye
was put out, and the giant was left blind. He felt around
the cave trying to catch his tormentors, but they contrived
to get out of his way. He then howled so loud
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
that his neighbors came to see what was the matter, when
he said, "I am hurt, Noman did it!" Then they said,
"If no man did it, we can not help you." So they went
home, leaving him groaning.</p>

<p>5. In the morning Polyphemus rolled away the stone
to let out his sheep and goats, and the Greeks contrived
to get out with them without being discovered. Once
out, they lost no time in driving the flocks down to the
shore, and then with their vessels well provisioned they
set sail once more for their native land.</p>

<span class="caption2"><i>Ulysses and his Dog.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>1. Ulysses, the lord of Ithaca, went to assist the
Greeks in the siege of Troy. For ten long years the war
lasted, and when Troy fell, Ulysses was ten more years
in reaching his home. He met with so many accidents
and adventures that delayed him, that even his stout heart
almost gave out as he thought of the wife and children
waiting for him through all these weary years. In the
mean time his son Telemachus had grown to manhood,
and had gone in search of his father.</p>

<p>2. During all this time his wife, Queen Penelope,
never lost hope, but lived daily looking for her husband
to come sailing over the sea. But while the master was
away, more than a hundred young lords laid claim to the
hand of Penelope, so as to obtain the power and riches of
Ulysses. They lorded it over the palace and people as
if they were the owners of both, and they paid no attention
to the wishes of Penelope, as she was but a woman,
and could not protect herself. Her only safety lay in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the fact that the suitors were jealous of each other, and
no one could make any advance until Penelope had made
her selection.
</p>

<p>3. At last Ulysses returned in the disguise of a beggar.
No one knew him except his old dog Argus, who,
in his excess of joy, died while licking
his hands. He made himself
known to EumÃ¦us, a faithful servant,
and by him was presented to
Telemachus, who had just returned.
Great was the joy of father and son
at thus meeting each other. Then
the three laid a plan to punish the
suitors and to rid Ithaca of their
presence. In carrying out this plan,
Telemachus went to his mother's
palace publicly, and the suitors bade
him welcome, though they secretly hated him, and had
tried to take his life. Here he found feasting going on,
and, at his request, the supposed beggar was admitted to
the foot of the table.
</p>

<p>4. Penelope had put off her decision on various pretexts
until now, when there appeared no other reason for
delay. So she announced that she would accept the one
who would shoot an arrow through twelve rings arranged
in a line. A bow formerly used by Ulysses was brought
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in and all other arms removed. All things being ready,
the first thing to be done was to attach the string to the
bow, which required the bow to be bent. Telemachus
tried and failed. Then each of the suitors tried in turn,
and all failed. They even rubbed the bow with tallow,
but it would not bend.</p>

<p>5. Here Ulysses spoke and said: "Beggar as I am, I
once was a soldier, and there is some strength in these
old limbs of mine yet. Let me try." The suitors hooted
at him, and would have turned him out of the hall; but
Telemachus said it was best to gratify the old man, and
so put the bow in his hand. Ulysses took it and easily
adjusted the cord. Then he selected an arrow and sent
it through the twelve rings at the first shot. Before the
suitors recovered from their astonishment he sent another
through the heart of the most insolent of them. Telemachus,
EumÃ¦us, and another faithful servant sprang to
their aid. The suitors looked around for arms, but there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
were none. Ulysses did not let them remain long in
doubt; he announced himself as the long-lost chief whose
house they had invaded, whose substance they had squandered,
and whose wife and son they had persecuted for
ten long years, and told them he meant to have ample
vengeance. All the suitors were slain but two, and Ulysses
was left master of his own palace and the possessor
of his kingdom and wife.</p>

<h2><i>V.&mdash;THOR'S VISIT TO JOTUNHEIM.</i></h2>

<p>1. Thor, the god of the Northmen, who always carried
a hammer to make his way or obtain his wishes,
heard of the giant's country, Jotunheim, of which Utgard
was the capital, and he resolved on a visit to that region
to try his strength with any one whom he might find.
So, accompanied by his servants, Thiolfi and Loki, he set
out. Thiolfi was of all men the swiftest on foot. At
nightfall they took refuge from a storm in a very large
building which they imperfectly saw in the dim light,
but were kept awake by loud thunder which shook their
abode like an earthquake. In the morning it was found
that the thunder was the snoring of a huge giant sleeping
near by, and that the building in which they had taken
shelter was the giant's glove.</p>

<p>2. The giant, whose name was Skrymer, knew Thor,
and proposed that they should travel together, to which
the god consented. At night they encamped, and soon
the giant was asleep. Thor, finding that he could not
untie the provision-bag which the giant had carried all
day, went into a rage and struck the sleeper a mighty
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
blow with, his hammer. Skrymer awoke and said, "The
leaves are falling, for one just now fell upon my breast."
They lay down again, and soon the giant began to snore
so loud that Thor could get no sleep, so he grasped
the hammer in both hands and dealt him another blow.
Skrymer awoke and called out, "How fares it with thee,
Thor? A bird must be overhead&mdash;a bunch of moss has just
now fallen upon me." Just before daylight Thor thought
that he would end this matter then, so he seized his hammer
and threw it with all his might. Skrymer awoke,
and stroking his cheek said, "An acorn fell upon my head.
But let us be stirring, as we have a long day before us."</p>

<p>3. When within sight of the city Skrymer turned off,
as his route lay in another direction, and soon Thor and
his companions were in presence of the giant king. Addressing
Thor, the king asked if he or his companions
could do anything better than others, for he said that no
one was permitted to remain in the city unless he excelled
in something.</p>

<p>4. Loki, who was a great eater, proposed a feast, and
the king called Logi to come out and compete with him.
A trough filled with meat was placed in the midst of the
hall, and Loki beginning at one end soon ate all the flesh
to the middle of the trough; but it was found that Logi
had devoured both flesh and bones and the trough to
boot. So the company adjudged Loki vanquished.</p>

<p>5. Next Thiolfi presented himself to run a race, and
the king brought out a young man named Hugi to run
with him. Hugi ran over the course and turning back
met Thiolfi but just started. Then the king remarked
that if Thor could not do better than his servants, it were
well that he stay at home. Then a drinking-match was
proposed, and a drinking horn was brought in. It was
not very large, but was of great length, and the king
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
remarked that any one of his subjects ought to empty
it at a single draught, but none would fail to do so in
three draughts. Thor drank long and deep, but the horn
was as full as before; a second trial met with a similar
failure. Then Thor straightened himself for a mighty
effort and drank as the thirsty earth drinks of the rains
from heaven. The liquor was diminished, but still the
horn was nearly full. "I perceive," said the king, "that
thou canst not be very thirsty, or thou wouldst drink
more."</p>

<p>6. "What new trial do you propose?" said Thor.
"We have a trifling game here," said the king, "in which
we exercise none but children. It consists in merely lifting
my cat from the ground, and I should not have mentioned
it to the great Thor if I had not observed that
thou art by no means what we took thee for." As he
finished speaking, a large gray cat sprang into the hall.
Thor put forth all his mighty strength three times without
lifting her, though on the third trial one foot was
raised from the floor.</p>

<p>7. "Well," said the king, "only one trial remains for
thee. Thou must wrestle with somebody, and after thy
failures to-day none of our men will wrestle with thee."
So saying, the king called upon his old nurse, a toothless
crone, shaking and trembling on the edge of the grave.
Thor grasped her and put forth a mighty effort, but the
old woman stood fast. At last she grasped him in turn,
and he was thrown upon his knee. The king here interfered,
and the contests came to an end. The travelers,
however, were royally entertained, and after a good
night's rest, and a bountiful breakfast, they bade the king
good-by, and set out on their return.</p>

<p>8. Toward night they overtook a traveler, who proved
to be Skrymer, their former companion and guide, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
they encamped together in the very wood where they
passed their first night together. The giant, perceiving
the dejected looks of Thor, said, "Something appears to
trouble thee; has thy journey gone amiss?" Thereupon
Thor related the whole story of his failures. "Then,"
said the giant, "take heart, for thou hast performed
great wonders, but hast been the victim of delusions.
Observe me closely!" Thor looked, and saw that
Skrymer and the king were one and the same person.</p>

<p>9. "Now," said the king, "Loki devoured all that
was set before him, but Logi was Fire, and consumed
trough and all. Hugi, with whom Thiolfi was running,
was Thought, and not the swiftest runner can keep pace
with that. The horn that thou failedst to empty had its
lower end in the sea, and thou wilt see how the very
ocean is lowered by thy draught. The cat is the animal
that bears up the world, and thy last mighty effort caused
the solid earth to shake as with an earthquake. The old
woman with whom thou wrestledst was old age, and she
throws everybody." The king then pointed out the place
where Thor dealt his blows on the night of their first
meeting, and lo! three mighty chasms showed where the
solid mountains had been rent asunder.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><b><i>VI.&mdash;THE WOLF AND THE DOG.</i></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;lean, hungry wolf, fell in one
moonlight night with a jolly, plump,
well-fed mastiff, and after the first
greetings were passed, the wolf accosted
him: "You look extremely
well," said he, "I think I never saw a more graceful,
comely personage; but how comes it about, I beseech
you, that you should live so much better than I? I may
say, without vanity, that I venture fifty times more than
you do, and yet I am almost ready to perish with hunger."
The dog answered very bluntly: "Why, you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
may live as well as I if you will do the same services for
it." The wolf pricked up his ears at the proposal, and
requested to be informed what he must do to earn such
plentiful meals. "Very little," answered the dog; "only
to guard the house at night, and keep it from thieves and
beggars." "With all my heart," rejoined the wolf, "for
at present I have but a sorry time of it; and, I think, to
change my hard lodging in the woods, where I endure
rain, frost, and snow, for a warm roof over my head and
plenty of food, will be no bad bargain." "True," said
the dog, "therefore, you have nothing more to do than
to follow me."</p>

<p>2. As they were jogging along together, the wolf
spied a circle, worn round his friend's neck, and, being
almost as curious as some of a higher species, he could
not forbear asking what it meant. "Pooh! nothing,"
said the dog, "or at most a mere trifle." "Nay, but
pray," urged the wolf, "inform me." "Why, then," said
the dog, "perhaps it is the collar to which my chain is
fastened; for I am sometimes tied up in the day-time,
because I am a little fierce, and might bite people, and
am only let loose at night. But this is done with design
to make me sleep in the day, more than anything else,
that I may watch the better in the night-time. As soon
as the twilight appears, I am turned loose, and may go
where I please. Then my master brings me plates of
bones from the table with his own hands; and whatever
scraps are left by the family fall to my share, for you
must know I am a favorite with everybody. So, seeing
how you are to live, come along! Why, what is the matter
with you?" "I beg your pardon," replied the wolf, "but
you may keep your happiness to yourself. I am resolved
to have no share in your dinners. Half a meal, with liberty,
is, in my estimation, worth a full one without it."</p>

<h2><i>VII.&mdash;PARABLE OF THE LABORERS IN THE<br />
VINEYARD.</i></h2>

<p>1. For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
that is a householder, which went out early in the morning
to hire laborers into his vineyard.</p>

<p>2. And when he had agreed with the laborers for a
penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</p>

<p>3. And he went out about the third hour, and saw
others standing idle in the market-place,</p>

<p>4. And said unto them; go ye also into the vineyard,
and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they
went their way.</p>

<p>5. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour,
and did likewise.</p>

<p>6. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and
found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why
stand ye here all the day idle?</p>

<p>7. They say unto him, because no man hath hired us.
He saith unto them, go ye also into the vineyard; and
whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.</p>

<p>8. So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard
saith unto his steward, call the laborers, and give them
their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</p>

<p>9. And when they came that were hired about the
eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</p>

<p>10. But when the first came, they supposed that they
should have received more; and they likewise received
every man a penny.</p>

<p>11. And when they had received it, they murmured
against the good man of the house,</p>

<p>12. Saying, These last have wrought but one hour,
and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have
borne the burden and heat of the day.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13. But he answered one of them, and said, Friend,
I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a
penny?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
    14. Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give
unto this last, even as unto thee.</p>

<p>15. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with
mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</p>

<p>16. So the last shall be first, and the first last: for
many be called, but few chosen.</p>

<h2><i>VIII.&mdash;PARABLE OF THE SOWER AND THE SEED.</i></h2>

<p>1. The same day went Jesus out of the house, and
sat by the sea side.</p>

<p>2. And great multitudes were gathered together unto
him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole
multitude stood on the shore.</p>

<p>3. And he spake many things unto them in parables,
saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</p>

<p>4. And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way-side,
and the fowls came and devoured them up:</p>

<p>5. Some fell upon stony places, where they had not
much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they
had no deepness of earth:</p>

<p>6. And when the sun was up, they were scorched;
and because they had no root, they withered away.</p>

<p>7. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns
sprung up, and choked them:</p>

<p>8. But other fell into good ground, and brought
forth fruit, some a hundred-fold, some sixty-fold, some
thirty-fold.</p>

<p>9. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>10. And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why
speakest thou unto them in parables?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
    11. He answered and said unto them, Because it is
given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven, but to them it is not given.</p>

<h2><i>XI.&mdash;DAMON AND PYTHIAS.</i></h2>

<p>1. About four hundred years before the Christian
era, the government of Syracuse fell into the hands of
Dionysius, a successful general of the army. He dispossessed
the magistrates whom the people elected, and was
therefore a usurper. While ruling justly in the main,
he had a capricious temper, and often in his rage performed
actions which he sincerely regretted in his sober
moments. He was a good scholar, and very fond of philosophy
and poetry, and he delighted to have learned
men around him, and he had naturally a generous spirit;
but the sense that he was in a position that did not belong
to him, and that every one hated him for assuming it,
made him very harsh and suspicious. It is of him that
the story is told, that he had a chamber hollowed in the
rock near his state prison, and constructed with galleries
to conduct sounds like an ear, so that he might overhear
the conversation of his captives; and of him, too, is told
that famous anecdote which has become a proverb, that
on hearing a friend, named Damocles, express a wish to
be in his situation for a single day, he took him at his
word, and Damocles found himself at a banquet with
everything that could delight his senses, delicious food,
costly wine, flowers, perfumes, music, but with a sword
with the point almost touching his head, and hanging by
a single horse-hair! This was to show the condition in
which a usurper lived.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="caption2"><i>Damon and Pythias.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Thus Dionysius was in constant dread. He had a
wide trench round his bedroom, with a drawbridge that
he drew up and put down with his own hands; and he
put one barber to death for boasting that he held a razor
to the tyrant's throat every morning. After this he
made his young daughters shave him; and by-and-by he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 37]<br />[Pg 38]</a></span>
would not trust them with a razor, and caused them to
singe off his beard with hot nut-shells.</p>

<p>3. One philosopher, named Philoxenus, he sent to a
dungeon for finding fault with his poetry, but he afterward
composed another piece, which he thought so superior
that he could not be content without sending for this
adverse critic to hear it. When he had finished reading
it, he looked to Philoxenus for a compliment; but the
philosopher only turned round to the guards, and said
dryly, "Carry me back to prison." This time Dionysius
had the sense to laugh, and forgive his honesty.</p>

<p>4. All these stories may not be true; but that they
should have been current in the ancient world, shows
what was the character of the man of whom they were
told, how stern and terrible was his anger, and how easily
it was incurred. Among those who came under it was a
Pythagorean called Pythias, who was sentenced to death,
according to the usual fate of those who fell under his
suspicion.</p>

<p>5. Pythias had lands and relations in Greece, and he
entreated as a favor to be allowed to return thither and
arrange his affairs, engaging to return within a specified
time and suffer death. The tyrant laughed his request to
scorn. Once safe out of Sicily, who would answer for
his return? Pythias made reply that he had a friend
who would become security for his return; and while
Dionysius, the miserable man who trusted nobody, was
ready to scoff at his simplicity, another Pythagorean, by
name Damon, came forward and offered to become surety
for his friend, engaging that, if Pythias did not return
according to promise, to suffer death in his stead.</p>

<p>6. Dionysius, much astonished, consented to let Pythias
go, marveling what would be the issue of the affair.
Time went on, and Pythias did not appear. The Syracusans
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
watched Damon, but he showed no uneasiness.
He said he was secure of his friend's truth and honor, and
that if any accident had caused his delay, he should rejoice
in dying to save the life of one so dear to him.</p>

<p>7. Even to the last day Damon continued serene and
content, however it might fall out; nay, even when the
very hour drew nigh and still no Pythias. His trust was
so perfect that he did not even grieve at having to die for
a faithless friend who left him to the fate to which he
had unwarily pledged himself. It was not Pythias's own
will, but the winds and waves, so he still declared, when
the decree was brought and the instruments of death
made ready. The hour had come, and a few moments
more would have ended Damon's life, when Pythias duly
presented himself, embraced his friend, and stood forward
himself to receive his sentence, calm, resolute, and rejoiced
that he had come in time.</p>

<p>8. Even the dim hope they owned of a future state
was enough to make these two brave men keep their
word, and confront death for one another without quailing.
Dionysius looked on more struck than ever. He
felt that neither of such men must die. He reversed the
sentence of Pythias, and calling the two to his judgment-seat,
he entreated them to admit him as a third in their
friendship.</p>

<h2><i>XIII.&mdash;A NORSEMAN'S SWORD.</i></h2>

<p>1. The smelting of iron in the north of Europe is
believed to have commenced with the Finns or Laplanders,
the original inhabitants of Scandinavia, who then occupied
the localities where the best ores are still found.
The diminutive stature of these people compared with
that of their Gothic invaders, their skill in penetrating
the bowels of the earth in search of ores, the smoke
of their collieries, the flame and thunder of their furnaces
and forges, and, above all, the excellent temper
of the weapons wrought by them&mdash;all these conspired
to render them objects of superstitious wonder to the
Goths.</p>

<p>2. The legendary stories of that people are filled with
strange tales of the northern dwarfs, who lived in the
solid rock, and possessed magic skill in all the various
arts of the smith. One of these legends may be worth
citing, and the rather, because it relates to Vanlander, the
Scandinavian Vulcan, of whom many traditions are extant,
even in England, where he is styled Wayland Smith. At
the age of thirteen Vanlander was apprenticed by his
father, the giant Vade, to two of the dwarfs who dwelt in
the interior of the mountain, and he applied himself so
faithfully to their instructions, that in two years he
equaled his masters in knowledge of all the arts of smithery,
both black and white.</p>

<p>3. Being at the court of King Nidung, where his dexterity
as a smith became known, a rivalship arose between
him and Amilias, principal smith to the king. Amilias
challenged Vanlander to a trial of skill, upon condition
that the life of the vanquished should be at the disposal
of the victor. The terms proposed were that Vanlander
should forge a sword, and Amilias a helmet, cuirass, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
other defensive armor, and a twelvemonth was allowed for
preparation. If the sword of Vanlander penetrated the
armor of Amilias, the former
was to be declared the victor,
if otherwise, his life was forfeited
to his rival.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

    <p class="caption2"><i>A Norseman's Sword.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Amilias spent the whole year at his task, but Vanlander
did not commence his labors until two months
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
before the trial. He now, after seven days' labor, exhibited
to the king a sword of great beauty and excellent
temper, but too heavy for use. By way of testing its
edge, he took a cushion stuffed with wool a foot in
thickness, threw it into the river, and let it float with
the current against the edge of the sword, which cut it
fairly in two. The king thought this a sufficient proof,
but Vanlander was not satisfied.</p>

<p>5. He took the sword to his smithy, filed it quite to
dust, and after subjecting the filings to an odd process of
animal chemistry, he forged from them another sword of
somewhat smaller size than the first, though still rather
heavy. Upon testing this sword in the same manner as
before, it readily divided a cushion two feet in thickness,
and the king thought it the finest weapon in the world,
but Vanlander said he would have it half as good again
before he was done with it.</p>

<p>6. It was now reduced to filings, which were treated
as in the former instance, and in three weeks Vanlander
produced a sword of convenient size, inlaid with gold,
and with an ornamental hilt, all of the highest finish and
beauty. The king and the smith went again to the river
with a cushion three feet in thickness, which was thrown
into the water and driven against the blade as before.
The sword divided the cushion as easily as the water, and
without even checking its progress as it floated with the
current, and King Nidung declared its fellow could not
be found on earth.</p>

<p>7. At the appointed day Amilias put on his armor,
all of which was of double plates, and, declaring himself
ready for the trial, seated himself in a chair, and defied
his rival to do his worst. Vanlander stepped behind him,
gave him a blow upon the helmet, and asked him if he
felt the edge. "I felt as if cold water were running
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
through me," replied Amilias. "Shake yourself," said
Vanlander. His rival did so, and fell asunder, the sword
having cleft him to the chine.</p>

<h2><i>XIV.&mdash;THE STORY OF KING ALFRED AND ST.<br />
CUTHBERT.</i></h2>

<p>1. Now King Alfred was driven from his kingdom
by the Danes, and he lay hid three years in the Isle of
Glastonbury. And it came to pass on a day that all his
folk were gone out to fish, save only Alfred himself and
his wife and one servant whom he loved. And there
came a pilgrim to the king and begged for food. And
the king said to his servant, "What food have we in the
house?" And his servant answered, "My lord, we have
but one loaf and a little wine." Then the king gave
thanks to God, and said, "Give half of the loaf and half
of the wine to this poor pilgrim." So the servant did as
his lord commanded him, and gave to the pilgrim half of
the loaf and half of the wine, and the pilgrim gave great
thanks to the king.</p>

<p>2. And when the servant returned he found the loaf
whole, and the wine as much as there had been aforetime.
And he greatly wondered, and he wondered also how the
pilgrim had come into the isle, for that no man could
come there save by water, and the pilgrim had no boat.
And the king greatly wondered also. And at the ninth
hour came back the folk who had gone to fish. And they
had three boats full of fish, and they said, "Lo, we have
caught more fish this day than in all the three years that
we have tarried in this island!" And the king was glad,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and he and his folk were merry; yet he pondered much
upon that which had come to pass.</p>

<p>3. And when night came the king went to his bed,
and the king lay awake and thought of all that had come
to pass by day. And presently he saw a great light, like
the brightness of the sun, and he saw an old man with
black hair, clothed in priest's garments, and with a miter
on his head, and holding in his right hand a book of the
Gospels adorned with gold and gems. And the old man
blessed the king, and the king said unto him, "Who art
thou?" And he answered: "Alfred, my son, rejoice;
for I am he to whom thou didst this day give thine alms,
and I am called Cuthbert the Soldier of Christ.</p>

<p>4. "Now be strong and very courageous, and be of
joyful heart, and hearken diligently to the things which I
say unto thee; for henceforth I will be thy shield and
thy friend, and I will watch over thee and over thy sons
after thee. And now I will tell thee what thou must do:
Rise up early in the morning and blow thine horn thrice,
that thine enemies may hear it and fear, and by the ninth
hour thou shalt have around thee five hundred men harnessed
for the battle. And this shall be a sign unto thee
that thou mayst believe. And after seven days thou
shalt have, by God's gift and my help, all the folk of
this land gathered unto thee upon the mount that is
called Assaudun. And thus shalt thou fight against
thine enemies, and doubt not that thou shalt overcome
them.</p>

<p>5. "Be thou, therefore, glad of heart, and be strong
and very courageous, and fear not, for God hath given
thine enemies into thine hand. And he hath given thee
also all this land and the kingdom of thy fathers, to thee
and to thy sons and to thy sons' sons after thee. Be thou
faithful to me and to my folk, because that unto thee is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
given all the land of Albion. Be thou righteous, because
thou art chosen to be the king of all Britain. So may
God be merciful unto thee, and I will be thy friend, and
none of thine enemies shall ever be able to overcome
thee."</p>

<p>6. Then was King Alfred glad at heart, and he was
strong and very courageous, for that he knew that he
would overcome his enemies by the help of God and St.
Cuthbert his patron. So in the morning he arose and
sailed to the land, and blew his horn three times, and
when his friends heard it they rejoiced, and when his
enemies heard it they feared. And by the ninth hour,
according to the word of the Lord, there were gathered
unto him five hundred men of the bravest and dearest of
his friends.</p>

<p>7. And he spake unto them and told them all that
God had said unto them by the mouth of his servant
Cuthbert, and he told them that, by the gift of God and
by the help of St. Cuthbert, they would overcome their
enemies and win back their own land. And he bade
them, as St. Cuthbert had taught him, to be pious toward
God and righteous toward men. And he bade his
son Edward, who was by him, to be faithful to God
and St. Cuthbert, and so he should always have victory
over his enemies. So they went forth to battle and
smote their enemies and overcame them, and King Alfred
took the kingdom of all Britain, and he ruled well
and wisely over the just and the unjust for the rest of
his days.</p>

<h2><i>XV.&mdash;A ROLAND FOR AN OLIVER.</i></h2>

<p>1. Milon, or Milone, a knight of great family, and
distantly related to Charlemagne, having secretly married
Bertha, the emperor's sister, was banished from France.
After a long and miserable wandering on foot as mendicants,
Milon and his wife arrived at Sutri, in Italy, where
they took refuge in a cave, and in that cave Orlando was
born. There his mother continued, drawing a scanty
support from the compassion of the neighboring peasants,
while Milon, in quest of honor and fortune, went into
foreign lands. Orlando grew up among the children of
the peasantry, surpassing them all in strength and manly
graces.</p>

<p>2. Among his companions in age, though in station
far more elevated, was Oliver, son of the governor of the
town. Between the two boys a feud arose, that led to a
fight, in which Orlando thrashed his rival; but this did
not prevent a friendship springing up between the two
which lasted through life.</p>

<p>3. Orlando was so poor that he was sometimes half
naked. As he was a favorite of the boys, one day four
of them brought some cloth to make him clothes. Two
brought white and two red; and from this circumstance
Orlando took his coat-of-arms, or quarterings.</p>

<p>4. When Charlemagne was on his way to Rome, to
receive the imperial crown, he dined in public in Sutri.
Orlando and his mother that day had nothing to eat, and
Orlando, coming suddenly upon the royal party, and seeing
abundance of provisions, seized from the attendants
as much as he could carry off, and made good his retreat
in spite of their resistance.</p>

<p>5. The emperor, being told of this incident, was reminded
of an intimation he had received in a dream, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
ordered the boy to be followed. This was done by three
of the knights, whom Orlando would have encountered
with a cudgel on their entering the grotto, had not his
mother restrained him. When they heard from her who
she was, they threw themselves at her feet, and promised
to obtain her pardon from the emperor. This was easily
effected. Orlando was received into favor by the emperor,
returned with him to France, and so distinguished
himself that he became the most powerful support of the
throne and of Christianity.</p>

<p>6. On another occasion, Orlando encountered a puissant
Saracen warrior, and took from him, as the prize of
victory, the sword Durindana. This famous weapon had
once belonged to the illustrious prince Hector of Troy. It
was of the finest workmanship, and of such strength and
temper that no armor in the world could stand against it.</p>

<p>7. Guerin de Montglave held the lordship of Vienne,
subject to Charlemagne. He had quarreled with his sovereign,
and Charles laid siege to his city, having ravaged
the neighboring country. Guerin was an aged warrior,
but relied for his defense upon his four sons and two
grandsons, who were among the bravest knights of the
age. After the siege had continued two months, Charlemagne
received tidings that Marsilius, King of Spain, had
invaded France, and, finding himself unopposed, was advancing
rapidly in the southern provinces. At this intelligence,
Charles listened to the counsel of his peers,
and consented to put the quarrel with Guerin to the decision
of Heaven, by single combat between two knights,
one of each party, selected by lot.</p>

<p>8. The proposal was acceptable to Guerin and his sons.
The name of the four, together with Guerin's own, who
would not be excused, and of the two grandsons, who
claimed their lot, being put into a helmet, Oliver's was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
drawn forth, and to him, the youngest of the grandsons,
was assigned the honor and the peril of the combat. He
accepted the award with delight, exulting in being thought
worthy to maintain the cause of his family. On Charlemagne's
side Roland was designated champion, and
neither he nor Oliver knew who his antagonist was to be.</p>

<p>9. They met on an island in the RhÃ´ne, and the warriors
of both camps were ranged on either shore, spectators
of the battle. At the first encounter both lances
were shivered, but both riders kept their seats immovable.
They dismounted and drew their swords. Then
ensued a combat which seemed so equal, that the spectators
could not form an opinion as to the probable issue.
Two hours and more the knights continued to strike and
parry, to thrust and ward, neither showing any sign of
weariness, nor ever being taken at unawares.</p>

<p>10. At length Orlando struck furiously upon Oliver's
shield, burying Durindana in its edge so deeply that he
could not draw it back, and Oliver, almost at the same
moment, thrust so vigorously upon Orlando's <a name="breast" id="breast"></a>breastplate
that his sword snapped off at the handle. Thus were the
two warriors left weaponless. Scarcely pausing a moment,
they rushed upon one another, each striving to throw his
adversary to the ground, and, failing in that, each snatched
at the other's helmet to tear it away. Both succeeded,
and at the same moment they stood bareheaded face to
face, and Roland recognized Oliver, and Oliver Roland.
For a moment they stood still; and the next, with open
arms, rushed into one another's embrace. "I am conquered,"
said Orlando. "I yield me," said Oliver.</p>

<p>11. The people on the shore knew not what to make
of all this. Presently they saw the two late antagonists
standing hand-in-hand, and it was evident the battle was
at an end. The knights crowded around them, and with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
one voice hailed them as equal in glory. If there were
any who felt disposed to murmur that the battle was left
undecided, they were silenced by the voice of Ogier the
Dane, who proclaimed aloud that all had been done that
honor required, and declared that he would maintain that
award against all gainsayers.</p>

<p>12. The quarrel with Guerin and his sons being left
undecided, a truce was made for four days, and in that
time, by the efforts of Duke Namo on the one side, and of
Oliver on the other, a reconciliation was effected. Charlemagne,
accompanied by Guerin and his valiant family,
marched to meet Marsilius, who hastened to retreat across
the frontier.</p>

<h2><i>XVI.&mdash;THE LEGEND OF MACBETH.</i></h2>

<p>1. Soon after the Scots and Picts had become one
people, there was a king of Scotland called Duncan, a very
good old man. He had two sons, Malcolm and Donaldbane.
But King Duncan was too old to lead out his army
to battle, and his sons were too young to help him. Now
it happened that a great fleet of Danes came to Scotland
and landed their men in Fife and threatened to take possession
of that province. So a numerous Scottish army
was levied to go out to fight with them. The king intrusted
the command to Macbeth, a near kinsman.</p>

<p>2. This Macbeth, who was a brave soldier, put himself
at the head of the Scottish army and marched against
the Danes. And he took with him a near relative of his
own called Banquo, a brave and successful soldier. There
was a great battle fought between the Danes and the
Scots, and Macbeth and Banquo defeated the Danes and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
drove them back to their ships, leaving a great many of
their soldiers killed and wounded. Then Macbeth and
his army marched back to Forres in the north of Scotland,
rejoicing on account of their victory.</p>

<p>3. Now, at this time, there lived in the town of Forres
three old women, whom people thought were witches,
and supposed they could tell what was to come to pass.
These old women went and stood by the way-side, in a
great moor near Forres, and waited until Macbeth came
up. And then stepping before him as he was marching
at the head of his soldiers the first woman said, "All hail
Macbeth! hail to the Thane of Glamis!" The second said,
"All hail to the Thane of Cawdor!" Then the third
wishing to pay him a higher compliment, said: "All
hail Macbeth, that shall be King of Scotland!" While
Macbeth stood wondering what they could mean, Banquo
stepped forward and asked if they had not something
good to say to him. And they said he should not be so
great as Macbeth, yet his children should succeed to the
throne of Scotland and reign for a great number of years.</p>

<p>4. Before Macbeth had recovered from his surprise,
there came a messenger to tell him that his father was
dead; so that, he was Thane of Glamis; and then came
a second messenger from the king to thank Macbeth for
the great victory over the Danes, and to tell him that the
Thane of Cawdor had rebelled against the king, and that
the king had taken his office from him, and had sent to
make Macbeth Thane of Cawdor. Macbeth, seeing that
a part of their words came true, began to think how he
might become king as the three old women had predicted.
Now Lady Macbeth was a very wicked woman, and she
showed Macbeth that the only way to become king was
to kill good King Duncan. At first Macbeth would not
listen to her, but at last his ambition to be king became
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
so great that he resolved
to murder his kinsman
and best friend.</p>

<span class="caption2"><i>Macbeth.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p>5. To accomplish his
purpose he invited King
Duncan to visit him in his
own castle near Inverness,
and the king accepted the
invitation. Macbeth and his
lady received their distinguished
guests with great
seeming joy and made for
them a great feast. At the
close of the feast the king
retired to rest, and all the other guests followed his example.
The two personal attendants of the king whose
duty it was to watch over him while asleep, were purposely
made drunk by Lady Macbeth, and they fell upon
their couch in a profound slumber.</p>

<p>6. Then Macbeth came into King Duncan's room
about two o'clock in the morning. It was a terrible
stormy night, but the noise of the wind and the thunder
could not awaken the king, as he was old and weary with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
his journey; neither could it awaken the two sentinels.
They all slept soundly. So Macbeth stepped gently over
the floor and took the two dirks which belonged to the
sentinels and stabbed poor old King Duncan to the heart,
so he died without a groan. Then Macbeth put the bloody
daggers into the hands of the sleeping sentinels and daubed
their hands and faces with blood. Macbeth was frightened
at what he had done, but his wife made him wash
his hands and go to bed.</p>

<p>7. Early in the morning the nobles and gentlemen
who attended on the king assembled in the great hall of
the castle, and then they began to talk of what a dreadful
storm there had been the night before. They waited for
some time, but finding the king did not come out, one of
the noblemen went to see whether he was well or not.
But when he came into the room he found King Duncan
dead, and went back and spread the alarm. The
Scottish nobles were greatly enraged at the sight, and
Macbeth made believe he was more enraged than any of
them, and drawing his sword he killed the two attendants
of the king, still heavy with sleep in consequence
of the drink furnished by Lady Macbeth the night before.</p>

<p>8. Malcolm and Donaldbane, the two sons of Duncan,
when they saw their father dead, fled from the castle, as
they believed that Macbeth had committed the murder.
Malcolm, the eldest son, made his way to the English court,
and solicited aid to get possession of his father's throne.
In the mean time Macbeth took possession of the kingdom
of Scotland. The remembrance of his great crime continually
haunted him, and he became so sleepless as to be
nearly insane. He remembered that the witches had
said that the children of Banquo should reign as kings in
Scotland, and he became terribly jealous of his old friend
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and companion. At last he hired ruffians to waylay
Banquo and his sons and murder them. The scheme was
partially successful&mdash;Banquo was killed but the sons escaped,
and from him descended a long line of the early
Scottish kings.</p>

<p>9. But Macbeth was not more happy after he had
slain his friend and cousin Banquo. He knew that people
began to suspect him of his evil deeds, and he was
constantly afraid that some of his nobles would treat him
as he treated King Duncan. In his perplexity he sought
the three witches he had met before, to ask them what
was to happen to him in the future. They answered
him that he should not be conquered nor lose the crown of
Scotland until a great forest, called Birnam Wood should
come to attack him in his strong castle on Dunsinane
hill. As the distance between the two was about twelve
miles, Macbeth thought it was impossible that the trees
should ever come to assault him in his castle. He immediately
summoned all his nobles to assist him in strengthening
his castle at Dunsinane. All the nobles were
obliged to furnish oxen and horses to drag the heavy
stones and logs used on the fortification up the steep
hill.</p>

<p>10. One day Macbeth noticed a pair of oxen so tired
with their burden that they fell down under their load.
Upon inquiry he learned that they belonged to Macduff,
the Thane of Fife. The king, who was jealous of Macduff,
flew into a great rage and declared that "since the
Thane of Fife sends such worthless cattle as these to do
my labor, I will put his own neck into the yoke, and
make him drag the burden himself." A friend of Macduff
who heard this speech hastened to the king's castle
and informed Macduff who was walking about while the
dinner was preparing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
    11. Macduff snatched a loaf of bread from the table,
called for his horses and servants, and galloped off toward
his own castle of Kennoway in Fife. When Macbeth returned
he first asked what had become of Macduff, and
being informed that he had fled from Dunsinane, Macbeth
put himself at the head of a large force of his guards,
and immediately pursued. Macduff reached his castle
which is built upon the shore of the sea, a little in advance
of the king. He ordered his wife to shut the gates
of the castle and pull up the drawbridge, and on no account
permit the king or any of his soldiers to enter. In
the mean time he went aboard a small ship and put out to
sea.</p>

<p>12. Macbeth then summoned the lady to open the
gates and deliver up her husband. "Do you see," said
she, "yon white sail upon the sea? Yonder goes Macduff
to the court of England. You will never see him again
until he comes with young Prince Malcolm to pull you
down from the throne and put you to death. You will
never be able to put your yoke upon the neck of the
Thane of Fife."</p>

<p>13. Some say that Macbeth was so enraged at the escape
of Macduff that he stormed and took the castle, and
put to death the wife and children of Macduff. But
others say that Macbeth turned back from the strong castle
and its brave defenders, and returned to his own home
at Dunsinane. Macduff readily found Prince Malcolm
and the English king, fitted them out with an army.
Upon entering Scotland a large share of the nobles deserted
Macbeth and joined the forces of Malcolm. The
army marched as far as Birnam Wood where they encamped
to rest and recuperate.</p>

<p>14. Macbeth, in the mean time, shut himself up in
his castle, where he thought himself safe according to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the old woman's prophecy, until Birnam Wood should
advance against him, and this he never expected to see.
Malcolm's army having entirely recovered their strength
and vigor, at length were ready to march. As they were
about to start, Macduff advised each soldier to cut down
the bough of a tree and carry it so as to conceal the
strength of the army as they crossed the valley. The
sentinel on the castle walls saw all these green boughs advancing,
ran to Macbeth and informed him that the wood
of Birnam was moving toward the castle of Dunsinane.
The king at first called him a liar and threatened to put
him to death; but when he looked from the walls himself,
and saw the appearance of a forest approaching from
Birnam, he remembered the prediction, and felt that the
hour of his destruction had come.</p>

<p>15. His followers were also superstitious and began
to desert him. But Macbeth, at the head of those who
remained true to him sallied out, and was killed in a
hand-to-hand conflict with Macduff. This story, a tradition,
is told by Sir Walter Scott, and forms the foundation
of Shakespeare's tragedy of "Macbeth."</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">22. His host he parted had in three,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">As leaders ware and tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">And soon his spearmen on their foes<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Bore down on every side.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">23. At last these two stout earls did meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Like captains of great might,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Like lions wode, they laid on lode,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">And made a cruel fight.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">24. "Yield thee, Lord Percy," Douglas said.<br /></span>
<span class="i33">"In faith I will thee bring<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Where thou shalt high advancÃ¨d be<br /></span>
<span class="i33">By James, our Scottish king.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">25. "Thy ransom I will freely give,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">And this report of thee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Thou art the most courageous knight<br /></span>
<span class="i33">That ever I did see."<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">26. "No, Douglas," saith Earl Percy then,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">"Thy proffer I do scorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">I will not yield to any Scot<br /></span>
<span class="i33">That ever yet was born."<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">27. With that there came an arrow keen<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Out of an English bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Which struck Earl Douglas to the heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i33">A deep and deadly blow;<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">28. Who never spake more words than these<br /></span>
<span class="i33">"Fight on, my merry men all;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">For why, my life is at an end;<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Lord Percy sees my fall."<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">29. Then leaving life, Earl Percy took<br /></span>
<span class="i33">The dead man by the hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">And said: "Earl Douglas, for thy life<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Would I had lost my land!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">30. "In truth, my very heart doth bleed<br /></span>
<span class="i33">With sorrow for thy sake;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">For sure a more redoubted knight<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Mischance did never make."<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">31. A knight amongst the Scots there was<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Who saw Earl Douglas die,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Who straight in wrath did vow revenge<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Upon the Earl Percy.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">32. Sir Hugh Mountgomery was he called,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Who with a spear full bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Well mounted on a gallant steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Ran fiercely through the fight;<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">33. And past the English archers all,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Without a dread or fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">And through Earl Percy's body then<br /></span>
<span class="i33">He thrust his hateful spear.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">34. So thus did both these nobles die,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Whose courage none could stain.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">An English archer then perceived<br /></span>
<span class="i33">The noble earl was slain.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">35. Against Sir Hugh Mountgomery<br /></span>
<span class="i33">To right a shaft he set;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">The gray goose-wing that was thereon<br /></span>
<span class="i33">In his heart's blood was wet.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">36. This fight did last from break of day<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Till setting of the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">For when they rung the evening-bell<br /></span>
<span class="i33">The battle scarce was done.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">37. Of fifteen hundred Englishmen<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Went home but fifty-three;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">The rest in Chevy-Chase were slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Under the greenwood-tree.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">38. The news was brought to Edinburg,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Where Scotland's king did reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">That brave Earl Douglas suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Was with an arrow slain.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">39. "Oh, heavy news!" King James did say;<br /></span>
<span class="i33">"Scotland can witness be,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">I have not any captain more<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Of such account as he."<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">40. Like tidings to King Henry came<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Within as short a space,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">That Percy of Northumberland<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Was slain in Chevy-Chase;<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">41. "Now God be with him," said our king,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">"Since 'twill no better be;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">I trust I have within my realm<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Five hundred as good as he:<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">42. "Yet shall not Scot or Scotland say<br /></span>
<span class="i33">But I will vengeance take;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">I'll be revengÃ¨d on them all<br /></span>
<span class="i33">For brave Earl Percy's sake!"<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">43. This vow full well the king performed<br /></span>
<span class="i33">After at Humbledown:<br /></span>
<span class="i22">In one day fifty knights were slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">With lords of high renown;<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">44. And of the rest, of small account,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Did many hundreds die:<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Thus endeth the hunting of Chevy-Chase,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Made by the Earl Percy.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">45. God save the king and bless this land<br /></span>
<span class="i33">With plenty, joy, and peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">And grant, henceforth, that foul debate<br /></span>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">3. To grace his sports a courtly train<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The hills and valleys rend.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">4. Through the deep forest swift they pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through woods and thickets wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When down within a lonely dell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They found a new-born child.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">5. All in a scarlet kerchief laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of silk so fine and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A golden mantle wrapt him round,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pinned with a silver pin.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">6. The sudden sight surprised them all,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The courtiers gathered round;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They look, they call, the mother seek&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No mother could be found.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">7. At length the king himself drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, as he gazing stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The pretty babe looked up and smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And stretched his little hands.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">

    <span class="i0">8. "Now, by the rood," King Pepin says,<br /></span>

<span class="i33">A bairn of high degree.<br /></span>

<span class="i33">A wit beyond his years.<br /></span>

<span class="i33">He had no peer in France.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">14. And now the early down began<br /></span>

<span class="i22">When Valentine was dubbed a knight,<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">20. Up then rose Sir Valentine<br /></span>
<span class="i33">And claimed that arduous deed.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"Go forth and conquer," said the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">"And great shall be thy meed."<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">21. Well mounted on a milk-white steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">His armor white as snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">As well beseemed a virgin knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Who ne'er had fought a foe&mdash;<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">22. To Artois Forest he repairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">With all the haste he may,<br /></span>

<span class="i33">A-rending of his prey!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">23. His unkempt hair all matted hung<br /></span>
<span class="i33">His shaggy shoulders round;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">His eager eye all fiery glowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">His face with fury frowned.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">

    <span class="i0">24. Like eagle's talons grew his nails,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">His limbs were thick and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">And dreadful was the knotted oak<br /></span>
<span class="i33">He bare with him along.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">25. Soon as Sir Valentine approached,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">He starts with sudden spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">And yelling forth a hideous howl,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">He made the forest ring.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">26. As when a tiger fierce and fell<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Hath spied a passing roe,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">And leaps at once upon his throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">So sprang the savage foe.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">27. So lightly leaped with furious force,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">The gentle knight to seize,<br /></span>
<span class="i22">But met his tall uplifted spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Which sank him on his knees.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">28. A second stroke, so stiff and stern,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Had laid the savage low;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">But, springing up, he raised his club,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">And aimed a dreadful blow.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">29. The watchful warrior bent his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">And shunned the coming stroke;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Upon his taper spear it fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">And all to shivers broke.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">30. Then, lighting nimbly from his steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">He drew his burnished brand;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">The savage quick as lightning flew<br /></span>
<span class="i33">To wrest it from his hand.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">31. Three times he grasped the silver hilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Three times he felt the blade;<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Three times it fell with furious force,<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Three ghastly cuts it made.<br /></span>

<h2>EARLY EASTERN RECORD.</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><i>XIX.&mdash;SENNACHERIB.</i></h2>

<p>1. Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah,
saying, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, that which
thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria
I have heard.</p>

<p>2. This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning
him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised
thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of
Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</p>

<p>3. Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and
against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up
thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.</p>

<p>4. By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord,
and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots, I am
come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of
Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar-trees thereof,
and the choice fir-trees thereof: and I will enter into the
lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
    5. I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with
the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged
places.</p>

<p>6. Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it,
and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I
brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste
fenced cities into ruinous heaps.</p>

<p>7. Therefore their inhabitants were of small power,
they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the
grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on
the <a name="house" id="house"></a>housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.</p>

<p>8. But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy
coming in, and thy rage against me.</p>

<p>9. Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come
up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy
nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back
by the way by which thou camest.</p>

<p>10. And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat
this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the
second year that which springeth of the same; and in the
third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat
the fruits thereof.</p>

<p>11. And the remnant that is escaped of the house of
Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit
upward.</p>

<p>12. For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant,
and they that escape out of Mount Zion: the zeal of the
Lord of hosts shall do this.</p>

<p>13. Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the
king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor
shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield,
nor cast a bank against it.</p>

<p>14. By the way that he came, by the same shall he
return, and shall not come into this city, saith the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
    15. For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine
own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</p>

<p>16. And it came to pass that night, that the angel of
the Lord went out and smote in the camp of the Assyrians
a hundred fourscore and five thousand; and when

<h3>THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">2. Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That host with its banners at sunset was seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">3. For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And breathed on the face of the foe as he passed;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">4. And there lay the steed, with his nostrils all wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But through them there rolled not the breath of his pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.<br /></span>

<h2><i>XX.&mdash;GLAUCON.</i></h2>

<p>1. When Glaucon, the son of Ariston, attempted to
harangue the people, from a desire, though he was not
yet twenty years of age, to have a share in the government
of the state, no one of his relatives, or other friends,
could prevent him from getting himself dragged down
from the tribunal and making himself ridiculous; but
Socrates, who had a friendly feeling toward him on account
of Charmides, the son of Glaucon, as well as on
account of Plato, succeeded in prevailing on him, by his
sole dissuasion, to relinquish his purpose.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 140px;">
    <a name="p075-illus.jpg" id="p075-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p075-illus.jpg" width="140" height="256" alt="His bust" title="" />
    <p class="caption2"><i>Socrates.</i></p>
</div>
<p>2. Meeting him by chance, he first stopped him by
addressing him as follows, that he might be willing to
listen to him: "Glaucon," said he, "have you formed an
intention to govern the state for
us?" "I have, Socrates," replied
Glaucon. "By Jupiter," rejoined
Socrates, "it is an honorable office,
if any other among men be so;
for it is certain that, if you attain
your object, you will be able
yourself to secure whatever you
may desire, and will be in a condition
to benefit your friends;
you will raise your father's house,
and increase the power of your
country; you will be celebrated
first of all in your own city, and
afterward throughout Greece, and
perhaps, also, like Themistocles,
among the barbarians, and, wherever
you may be, you will be an object of general admiration."
Glaucon, hearing this, was highly elated, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
cheerfully stayed to listen. Socrates next proceeded to
say: "But it is plain, Glaucon, that if you wish to be
honored, you must benefit the state." "Certainly," answered
Glaucon. "Then, in the name of the gods," said
Socrates, "do not hide from us how you intend to act,
but inform us with what proceeding you will begin to
benefit the state." But as Glaucon was silent, as if just
considering how he should begin, Socrates said: "As, if
you wished to aggrandize the family of a friend, you
would endeavor to make it richer, tell me whether you
will in like manner also endeavor to make the state
richer?" "Assuredly," said he. "Would it then be
richer, if its revenues were increased?" "That is at least
probable," said Glaucon. "Tell me then," proceeded
Socrates, "from what the revenues of the state arise,
and what is their amount; for you have doubtless considered,
in order that if any of them fall short, you
may make up the deficiency, and that if any of them
fail, you may procure fresh supplies." "These matters,
by Jupiter," replied Glaucon, "I have not considered."</p>

<p>3. "Well, then," said Socrates, "if you have omitted
to consider this point, tell me at least the annual expenditure
of the state; for you undoubtedly mean to retrench
whatever is superfluous in it." "Indeed," replied Glaucon,
"I have not yet had time to turn my attention to
that subject." "We will therefore," said Socrates, "put
off making our state richer for the present; for how is it
possible for him who is ignorant of its expenditure and
its income to manage those matters?"</p>

<p>4. "But Socrates," observed Glaucon, "it is possible
to enrich the state at the expense of our enemies." "Extremely
possible, indeed," replied Socrates, "if we be
stronger than they; but if we be weaker, we may lose all
that we have." "What you say is true," said Glaucon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
    5. "Accordingly," said Socrates, "he who deliberates
with whom he shall go to war, ought to know the
force both of his own country and of the enemy,
so that, if that of his own country be superior
to that of the enemy, he may
advise it to enter upon the war, but if
inferior, may persuade it to be cautious of doing so."
"You say rightly," said Glaucon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="p077-illus.jpg" id="p077-illus.jpg"></a>

 <p class="caption2"><i>Socrates and Glaucon.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. "In the first place, then," proceeded Socrates, "tell
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
us the strength of the country by land and sea, and next
that of the enemy." "But, by Jupiter," exclaimed Glaucon,
"I should not be able to tell you on the moment, and
at a word." "Well, then, if you have it written down,"
said Socrates, "bring it, for I should be extremely glad
to hear what it is." "But, to say the truth," replied
Glaucon, "I have not yet written it down."</p>

<p>7. "We will therefore put off considering about war
for the present," said Socrates, "for it is very likely that
on account of the magnitude of these subjects, and as you
are just commencing your administration, you have not
yet examined into them. But to the defense of the country,
I am quite sure that you have directed your attention,
and that you know how many garrisons are in advantageous
positions, and how many not so, what number
of men would be sufficient to maintain them, and what
number would be insufficient, and that you will advise
your countrymen to make the garrisons in advantageous
positions stronger, and to remove the useless ones."</p>

<p>8. "By Jove," replied Glaucon, "I shall recommend
them to remove them all, as they keep guard so negligently,
that the property is secretly carried off out of the
country." "Yet, if we remove the garrisons," said Socrates,
"do you not think that liberty will be given to
anybody that pleases to pillage? But," added he, "have
you gone personally and examined as to this fact, or
how do you know that the garrisons conduct themselves
with such negligence?" "I form my conjectures,"
said he. "Well, then," inquired Socrates, "shall we
settle about these matters also, when we no longer rest
upon conjecture, but have obtained certain knowledge?"
"Perhaps that," said Glaucon, "will be the better
course."</p>

<p>9. "To the silver-mines, however," continued Socrates,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
"I know that you have not gone, so as to have the means
of telling us why a smaller revenue is derived from them
than came in some time ago." "I have not gone thither,"
said he. "Indeed, the place," said Socrates, "is said to
be unhealthy, so that when it is necessary to bring it under
consideration, this will be a sufficient excuse for you."
"You jest with me," said Glaucon. "I am sure, however,"
proceeded Socrates, "that you have not neglected
to consider, but have calculated, how long the corn which
is produced in the country, will suffice to maintain the
city, and how much it requires for the year, in order that
the city may not suffer from scarcity unknown to you,
but that, from your own knowledge, you may be able, by
giving your advice concerning the necessaries of life, to
support the city and preserve it." "You propose a vast
field for me," observed Glaucon, "if it will be necessary
for me to attend to such subjects."</p>

<p>10. "Nevertheless," proceeded Socrates, "a man can
not order his house properly, unless he ascertains all that
it requires, and takes care to supply it with everything
necessary; but since the city consists of more than ten
thousand houses, and since it is difficult to provide for so
many at once, how is it that you have not tried to aid one
first of all, suppose that of your uncle, for it stands in
need of help? If you be able to assist that one, you may
proceed to assist more; but if you be unable to benefit
one, how will you be able to benefit many? Just as it is
plain that, if a man can not carry the weight of a talent,
he need not attempt to carry a greater weight?"</p>

<p>11. "But I would improve my uncle's house," said
Glaucon, "if he would but be persuaded by me." "And
then," resumed Socrates, "when you can not persuade
your uncle, do you expect to make all the Athenians, together
with your uncle, yield to your arguments?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
    12. "Take care, Glaucon, lest, while you are eager to
acquire glory, you meet with the reverse of it. Do you
not see how dangerous it is for a person to speak of, or
undertake, what he does not understand? Contemplate,
among other men, such as you know to be characters that
plainly talk of, and attempt to do, what they do not know,
and consider whether they appear to you, by such conduct,
to obtain more applause or censure, whether they
seem to be more admired or despised?</p>

<p>13. "Contemplate, again, those who have some understanding
of what they say and do, and you will find, I
think, in all transactions, that such as are praised and admired
are of the number of those who have most knowledge,
and that those who incur censure and neglect are
among those that have least.</p>

<p>14. "If, therefore, you desire to gain esteem and reputation
in your country, endeavor to succeed in gaining a
knowledge of what you wish to do; for if, when you excel
others in this qualification, you proceed to manage the
affairs of the state, I shall not wonder if you very easily
obtain what you desire."</p>

<h2><i>XXI.&mdash;CYRUS AND HIS GRANDFATHER.</i></h2>

<p>1. When Cyrus was twelve years old, his mother
Mandana took him with her into Media to his grandfather
Astyages, who, from the many things he had
heard in favor of the young prince, had a great desire to
see him. In this court young Cyrus found very different
manners from those of his own country: pride, luxury,
and magnificence reigned here universally. Astyages
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
himself was richly clothed, had his eyes colored, his face
painted, and his hair embellished with artificial locks;
for the Medes affected an effeminate life&mdash;to be dressed
in scarlet and to wear necklaces and bracelets&mdash;whereas
the habits of the Persians were very plain and coarse.</p>

<p>2. All this finery had no effect upon Cyrus, who,
without criticising or condemning what he saw, was content
to live as he had been brought up, and adhered to
the principles he had imbibed from his infancy. He
charmed his grandfather with his sprightliness and wit,
and gained the favor of all by his noble and engaging behavior.
I shall only mention one instance, whereby we
may judge of the rest. Astyages, to make his grandson
unwilling to return home, made a sumptuous entertainment,
in which there was a vast plenty and profusion of
everything that was nice and delicate. Cyrus looked
upon all this exquisite cheer and magnificent preparation
with great indifference, and, observing that it excited the
surprise of Astyages, "The Persians," says he to the
king, "instead of going such a roundabout way to appease
their hunger, have a much shorter one to the same end:
a little bread and cresses with them answer the purpose."</p>

<p>3. Astyages desiring Cyrus to dispose of all the meats
as he thought fit, the latter immediately distributed them
to the king's officers-in-waiting: to one, because he taught
him to ride; to another, because he waited well upon his
grandfather; and to a third, because he took great care
of his mother. Sacas, the king's cup-bearer, was the only
person to whom he gave nothing. This officer, besides
the post of cup-bearer, had that likewise of introducing
those who were to have audience with the king; and, as
he could not possibly grant that favor to Cyrus as often
as he desired it, he had the misfortune to displease the
prince, who took this occasion to show his resentment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
    4. Astyages, manifesting some concern at the neglect
of this officer, for whom he had a particular regard, and
who deserved it, as he said, on account of the wonderful
dexterity with which he served him&mdash;"Is that all,
father?" replied Cyrus; "if that be sufficient to merit
your favor, you shall see I will quickly obtain it; for I
will take upon me to serve you better than he." Cyrus
immediately equipped as a cup-bearer, and advancing
gravely with a serious countenance, a napkin upon his
shoulder, and holding the cup nicely with three of his
fingers, presented it to the king with a dexterity and a
grace that charmed both Astyages and Mandana. When
he had done he threw himself upon his grandfather's
neck, and, kissing him, cried out with great joy: "O
Sacas! poor Sacas! thou art undone; I shall have thy
place!"</p>

<p>5. Astyages embraced him with great fondness, and
said: "I am highly pleased, my dear child; nobody can
serve me with a better grace; but you have forgot one
essential ceremony, which is that of tasting"; and, indeed,
the cup-bearer was used to pour some of the liquor
into his left hand, and to taste it, before he presented it
to the king. "No," replied Cyrus, "it was not through
forgetfulness that I omitted that ceremony." "Why,
then," says Astyages, "for what reason did you not do
it?" "Because I apprehended there was poison in the
liquor." "Poison, child! How could you think so?"
"Yes, poison, father, for not long ago, at an entertainment
you gave to the lords of your court, after the guests
had drunk a little of that liquor, I perceived all their
heads were turned. They sang, made a noise, and talked
they did not know what; you yourself seemed to have
forgotten that you were king, and they that they were
subjects; and when you would have danced you could
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
not stand upon your legs." "Why," said Astyages,
"have you never seen the same thing happen to your
father?" "No, never," says Cyrus. "What, then?
How is it with him when he drinks?" "Why, when he
has drunk, his thirst is quenched, and that is all."</p>

<p>6. Mandana being upon the point of returning to
Persia, Cyrus joyfully complied with the repeated requests
his grandfather had made to him to stay in Media;
being desirous, as he said, to perfect himself in the art of
riding, which he was not yet master of, and which was
not known in Persia, where the barrenness of the country
and its craggy, mountainous situation rendered it
unfit for the breeding of horses.</p>

<p>7. During the time of his residence at this court his
behavior procured him infinite love and esteem. He was
gentle, affable, beneficent, and generous. Whenever the
young lords had any favor to ask of the king, Cyrus was
their solicitor. If the king had any subject of complaint
against them, Cyrus was their mediator; their affairs became
his, and he always managed them so well that he
obtained whatever he desired.</p>

<div class="signature"><i>Rollin.</i></div>


<hr />
<h2><i>XXII.&mdash;CYRUS AND THE ARMENIANS.</i></h2>

<p>1. The King of Armenia who was vassal to the
Medes, looking upon them as ready to be swallowed up
by a formidable league formed against them, thought fit
to lay hold of this occasion to shake off their yoke. Accordingly
he refused to pay them the ordinary tribute,
and to send them the number of troops he was obliged to
furnish in time of war. This highly embarrassed Cyaxares,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
who was afraid at this juncture of bringing new
enemies upon his hands if he undertook to compel the
Armenians to execute their treaty.</p>

<p>2. But Cyrus, having informed himself exactly of the
strength and situation of the country, undertook the affair.
The important point was to keep his design secret, without
which it was not likely to succeed. He therefore appointed
a great hunting-match on that side of the country;
for it was his custom to ride out that way, and frequently
to hunt with the king's son and the young noblemen
of Armenia. On the appointed day, he set out
with a numerous retinue. The troops followed at a distance,
and were not to appear till a signal was given.
After some days' hunting, when they had nearly reached
the palace where the court resided, Cyrus communicated
his design to his officers; and sent Chrysanthes with a
detachment, ordering them to make themselves master of
a certain steep eminence, where he knew the king used
to retire in case of an alarm, with his family and his
treasures.</p>

<p>3. This being done, he sent a herald to the king of
Armenia, to summon him to perform the treaty, and in
the mean time ordered his troops to advance. Never was
a court in greater surprise and perplexity. The king
was conscious of the wrong he had done, and was not in
a condition to support it. However, he did what he
could to assemble his forces together from all quarters;
and in the mean time dispatched his youngest son, called
Stabaris, into the mountains, with his wives, his daughters,
and whatever was most precious and valuable. But
when he was informed by his scouts that Cyrus was closely
pursuing, he entirely lost all courage, and all thoughts
of making a defense.</p>

<p>4. The Armenians, following his example, ran away,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
every one where he could, to secure what was dearest to
him. Cyrus, seeing the country covered with people
that were endeavoring to make their escape, sent them
word that no harm should be done to them if they stayed
in their houses; but that as many as were taken running
away should be treated as enemies. This made them all
retire to their habitations, excepting a few that followed
the king.</p>

<p>5. On the other hand, they that were conducting the
princesses to the mountains fell into the ambush Chrysanthes
had laid for them, and were most of them taken
prisoners. The queen, the king's son, his daughters, his
eldest son's wife, and his treasures, all fell into the hands
of the Persians.</p>

<p>6. The king, hearing this melancholy news, and not
knowing what would become of him, retired to a little
eminence, where he was presently invested by the Persian
army, and obliged to surrender. Cyrus ordered him
with all his family to be brought to the midst of the
army. At that very instant arrived Tigranes, the king's
eldest son, who was just returned from a journey. At so
moving a scene he could not forbear weeping. Cyrus,
addressing himself to him, said: "Prince, you are come
very seasonably to be present at the trial of your father."
And immediately he assembled the captains of the Persians
and Medes, and called in also the great men of Armenia.
Nor did he so much as exclude the ladies from
this assembly, who were there in their chariots, but gave
them full liberty to hear and see all that passed.</p>

<p>7. When all was ready and Cyrus had commanded
silence, he began with requiring of the king, that in all
the questions he was about to propose to him, he would
answer sincerely, because nothing could be more unworthy
a person of his rank than to use dissimulation or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
falsehood. The king promised he would. Then Cyrus
asked him, but at different times, proposing each article
separately, and in order, whether it was not true, that he
had made war upon Astyages, King of the Medes, his
grandfather; whether he had not been overcome in that
war, and in consequence of his defeat had concluded a
treaty with Astyages; whether by virtue of that treaty
he was not obliged to pay a certain tribute, to furnish a
certain number of troops, and not to keep any fortified
place in his country.</p>

<p>8. It was impossible for the king to deny any of
these facts, which were all public and notorious. "For
what reason, then," continued Cyrus, "have you violated
the treaty in every article?" "For no other," replied
the king, "than because I thought it a glorious thing to
shake off the yoke, to live free, and to leave my children
in the same condition." "It is really glorious," answered
Cyrus, "to fight in defense of liberty, but if any one,
after he is reduced to servitude, should attempt to run
away from his master, what would you do with him?"
"I must confess," said the king, "I would punish him."
"And if you had given a government to one of your subjects,
and he should be found to misbehave, would you
continue him in his post?" "No, certainly; I would
put another in his place." "And if he had amassed great
riches by his unjust practices?" "I would strip him of
them." "But, which is still worse, if he had held intelligence
with your enemies, how would you treat him?"
"Though I should pass sentence upon myself," replied
the king, "I must declare the truth; I would put him
to death." At these words Tigranes tore his tiara from
his head, and rent his garments; the women burst out
into lamentations and outcries, as if the sentence had
actually passed upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
    9. Cyrus, having again commanded silence, Tigranes
addressed himself to the prince to this effect: "Great
prince, can you think it consistent with your wisdom, to
put my father to death, even against your own interest?"
"How against my interest?" replied Cyrus. "Because
he was never so capable of doing you service." "How
do you make that appear? Do the faults we commit enhance
our merit, and give us a new title to consideration
and favor?" "They certainly do, provided they serve
to make us wiser; for wisdom is of inestimable value.
Are either riches, courage, or address to be compared to
it? Now it is evident, this single day's experience has
infinitely improved my father's wisdom. He knows how
dear the violation of his word has cost him. He has
proved and felt how much you are superior to him in all
respects. He has not been able to succeed in any of his
designs; but you have happily accomplished all yours;
and with such expedition and secrecy that he has found
himself surrounded and taken before he expected to be
attacked, and the very place of his retreat has served only
to ensnare him."</p>

<p>10. "But your father," replied Cyrus, "has yet
undergone no sufferings that can have taught him wisdom."
"The fear of evils," answered Tigranes, "when it is so
well founded as this is, has a much sharper sting, and is
more capable of piercing the soul, than the evil itself.
Besides, permit me to say, that gratitude is a stronger and
more prevailing motive than any whatever; and there
can be no obligations in the world of a higher nature
than those you will lay upon my father&mdash;his fortune,
liberty, scepter, life, wives, and children, all restored to
him with such a generosity. Where can you find, illustrious
prince, in one single person, so many strong and powerful
ties to attach him to your service?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
    11. "Well, then," replied Cyrus, turning to the king,
"if I should yield to your son's entreaties, with what
number of men, and what sum of money, will you assist
us in the war against the Babylonians?" "My troops
and treasures," says the Armenian king, "are no longer
mine; they are entirely yours. I can raise forty thousand
foot and eight thousand horse; and as for money, I
reckon, including the treasure which my father left me,
there are about three thousand talents ready money. All
these are wholly at your disposal." Cyrus accepted half
the number of the troops, and left the king the other
half, for the defense of the country against the Chaldeans,
with whom he was at war.</p>

<p>12. The annual tribute which was due to the Medes
he doubled, and instead of fifty talents exacted a hundred,
and borrowed the like sum over and above in his own
name. "But what would you give me," added Cyrus,
"for the ransom of your wives?" "All that I have in
the world," replied the king. "And for the ransom of
your children?" "The same thing." "From this time,
then, you are indebted to me the double of all your possessions.
And you, Tigranes, at what price would you
redeem the liberty of your lady?" Now he had lately
married her, and was passionately fond of her. "At the
price," said he, "of a thousand lives if I had them."
Cyrus then conducted them all to his tent, and entertained
them at supper. It is easy to imagine what transports
of joy there must have been upon this occasion.</p>

<p>13. After supper, as they were discoursing upon various
subjects, Cyrus asked Tigranes what was become of
a governor whom he had often seen hunting with him,
and for whom he had a particular esteem. "Alas!"
said Tigranes, "he is no more; and I dare not tell you by
what accident I lost him." Cyrus pressed him to tell
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
him. "My father," continued Tigranes, "seeing I had a
very tender affection for this governor, and that I was
extremely attached to him, suspected it might be of some
ill consequence and put him to death. But he was so
honest a man, that as he was ready to expire, he sent for
me and spoke to me in these words: 'Tigranes, let not
my death occasion any dissatisfaction in you toward the
king your father. What he has done to me did not proceed
from malice, but only from prejudice, and a false
notion wherewith he was unhappily blinded.'" "Oh, the
excellent man!" cried Cyrus, "never forget the last advice
he gave you."</p>

<p>14. When the conversation was ended, Cyrus, before
they parted, embraced them all, as in token of a perfect
reconciliation. This done, they got into their chariots,
with their wives, and went home full of gratitude and admiration.
Nothing but Cyrus was mentioned the whole
way; some extolling his wisdom, others his valor; some
admiring the sweetness of his temper, others praising the
beauty of his person and the majesty of his mien. "And
you," said Tigranes, addressing himself to his lady, "what
do you think of Cyrus's aspect and deportment?" "I
do not know," replied the lady, "I did not observe him."
"Upon what object, then, did you fix your eyes?"
"Upon him that said he would give a thousand lives to
ransom my liberty."</p>

<p>The next day the King of Armenia sent presents to
Cyrus, and refreshments for his whole army, and brought
him double the sum of money he was required to furnish.
But Cyrus took only what had been stipulated, and restored
him the rest. The Armenian troops were ordered
to be ready in three days' time, and Tigranes desired to
command them.</p>

<h2><i>XXIII.&mdash;THE MACEDONIAN EMPIRE.</i></h2>

<p>1. After the battle of PlatÃ¦a, in which the army of
the Persian king Xerxes was defeated and destroyed, the
Greek states became the dominant power in the civilized
world, and the Greek cities became centers of influence
and art. Under Pericles, the successor of Themistocles,
Athens, in richness and beauty of her palaces and temples,
arrived at a point of excellence which far surpassed
anything the world had before seen. But jealousies between
different states led to civil wars that desolated the
whole land, and in the next one hundred and fifty years
scarcely any progress was made in adding to the national
strength. While these bloody wars were going on principally
between Sparta and Athens, the tribes of Macedon,
a region lying immediately north of Greece, were
rapidly becoming civilized and consolidated. In 359 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>
Philip became the reigning monarch.</p>

<p>2. He was very desirous of being considered as a
Greek, invited distinguished men to his court, and ordered
public rejoicings in his kingdom when his chariots had
won the prize at the Olympic games. He was very
clever, and cared little about the justice and honor of the
means by which he attained his ends, which were, to hold
in subjection all the rest of Greece, and to conquer Persia.
In the first design he succeeded, for the latter he
only prepared the way for his son. He had both to form
his officers and his army. The first he attempted by
bringing the young nobles to his court, and there instructing
them; and in the last he succeeded in a remarkable
manner.</p>

<p>3. The chief strength of the army, as he constituted
it, was in the phalanx, a body of sixteen thousand foot
soldiers, fully armed in the Greek fashion, with spears
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
twenty-four feet long. When drawn up in order of battle,
the four front ranks held their spears pointing outward,
and stood at such a space apart, that the foremost
line had four spear-points between each man and the
enemy, or on occasion they marched with their shields
touching, so as to form an almost impenetrable wall.</p>

<p>4. As soon as Philip's designs against Greece were
apparent, a strong spirit of resistance showed itself, and
chiefly at Athens, where the great orator, Demosthenes,
never ceased to rouse his countrymen to maintain their
freedom. Demosthenes had trained himself in eloquence
under great difficulties; he naturally either stammered,
or had an indistinct pronunciation&mdash;a defect which he
cured by speaking with pebbles in his mouth, and he
used to rehearse his speeches to the roaring sea, in order
to nerve himself against the clamors of a tumultuous assembly.
He so far succeeded, that he often swayed the
minds of the Athenians; his name stands as the first of
orators, and his Philippics, as his discourses against Philip
are called, are considered as models of rhetoric.</p>

<p>5. At CheronÃ¦a, in 338, a battle was fought by
Philip against the allied forces of the Athenians and Thebans.
At one time the Athenians gained some advantage,
but they used it so ill, that Philip, calling out to his
troops, "They do not know how to conquer," made a
sudden charge, and routed them with great slaughter.
The battle of CheronÃ¦a was the end of the independence
of Greece, which from that time forward became subject
to Macedon, in spite of its many struggles to shake off
the yoke, and recover the liberty which had been lost for
want of a firm, united, settled government.</p>

<p>6. The King of Macedon next commenced his arrangements
for his other favorite scheme&mdash;the invasion
of Asia; but in the year 336, in the midst of the feasts in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
honor of his daughter's marriage, he was murdered by a
young Macedonian noble, who was slain in the first anger
of the surrounding guards, without having time to disclose
the motive of his crime.</p>

<p>7. Alexander, son of Philip and his Epirot queen
Olympias, was twenty years of age when he came to
the throne. On the night of his birth the temple of
Diana, at Ephesus, was burned to the ground by a
man named Erostratus, in the foolish desire of making
himself notorious, and this Alexander liked to consider
as an omen that he should himself kindle a flame
in Asia.</p>

<p>8. He traced his descent from his father's side from
Hercules, and by his mother's from Achilles, and throughout
his boyhood he seems to have lived in a world of the
old Greek poetry, sleeping with Homer's works under
his pillow, and dreaming of deeds in which he should
rival the fame of the victors of Troy. He was placed
under the care of Aristotle, the great philosopher of Stagira,
to whom, when Philip had written to announce Alexander's
birth, he had said that he knew not whether
most to rejoice at having a son, or that his son would
have such a teacher as Aristotle.</p>

<p>9. From him the young Alexander learned to think
deeply, to resolve firmly, and devise plans of government;
by others he was instructed in all the graceful accomplishments
of the Greeks, and under his father he was
trained to act promptly. At fourteen he tamed the noble
horse Bucephalus, which no one else dared to mount;
two years later he rescued his father in a battle with the
Scythians, and he commanded the cavalry at CheronÃ¦a,
but he was so young at the time of his accession, that
the Greeks thought they had nothing to fear from him.</p>

 <p class="caption2"><i>Battle on the Granicus.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>10. There were very ungenerous rejoicings at Athens
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 93]<br />[Pg 94]</a></span>
at the murder of Philip. Demosthenes, though he had
just lost a daughter, crowned himself with a wreath of
flowers, and came with great tokens of joy to announce it
to the Athenians so soon after the event, as almost to excite
a suspicion that he must have been concerned in the
crime. But they found that their joy was unfounded, for
no sooner did Thebes take up arms, than Alexander
marched against it, destroyed the walls, killed many of the
citizens, and blotted it out from the number of Greek
cities. The other states did not dare to make any further
opposition, and he was thus at leisure to prepare for the
invasion of Persia.</p>

<p>11. Leaving Antipater as governor of Macedon, he
set out in the spring of 334, at the head of thirty thousand
infantry and four thousand five hundred cavalry, and bade
farewell to his native land, which he was never to see
again. He crossed the Hellespont, and was the first man
to leap on Asiatic ground; then, while his forces were
landing, he went to visit the spot which had so long been
the object of his dreams&mdash;the village which marked the
site of Troy. He offered a sacrifice at the tomb of
Achilles, hung up his own shield in the temple, and took
down one which was said to be a relic of the Greek conquerors,
intending to have it always borne before him in
battle.</p>

<p>12. His march was at first toward the east, along the
shore of the Hellespont, until at the river Granicus he
met the Persians drawn up on the other bank of the river,
under the command of the satrap Memnon. Alexander
himself, at the head of his cavalry, charged through the
midst of the rapid stream, won the landing-place, and followed
by the phalanx, quickly gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>13. All the neighboring country fell into his hands,
and after taking possession of it, he changed his course,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
marching along the shores of the Ãgean, and taking all
the towns. It was his first object to cut the Persians off
from their seaports, and thus deprive them of the use of
their fleet, which was so superior to his own, that he never
ventured on one sea-fight.</p>

<p>14. This march round the western and southern coasts
of Asia Minor, together with an expedition into the interior,
occupied a year, and in the early part of the summer,
he arrived at Tarsus, in Cilicia. Here, on entering
the city, overwhelmed with heat and fatigue, he bathed
in the cold waters of the Cydnus, and the chill brought
on a violent fever, which nearly cost him his life. A
letter was sent to warn him that his physician, Philip,
had been bribed by the Persian king to poison him.
While he was reading it the physician himself brought
him a draught of medicine; the king put the letter into
his hand, took the cup and drank it off, even before
Philip could profess his innocence. In three days' time
he was again able to appear at the head of his troops, and
not before he was needed, for the enemy's army was near
at hand, under King Darius Codomanus himself.</p>

<p>15. The Persians advanced in great state. First came
a number of persons bearing silver altars, on which burned
the sacred fire; then followed the Magi, and three hundred
and sixty-five youths robed in scarlet, in honor of
the days of the year. Next came the chariot and horses
of the Sun, with their attendants, and afterward the army
itself, the Immortal Band, with gold-handled lances, white
robes, and jeweled corslets, and a host of others of less
note, all far more fit for show than for battle. Darius
himself, arrayed in purple robes and glittering with jewels,
was in the midst, in a chariot covered with gold ornaments,
and with him came his mother, Sisygambis, his
principal wife, his daughters, a number of other ladies,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
and a multitude of slaves. This unwieldy and useless
host took up their position on the hilly ground above the
city of Issus, where they were so entangled among the
rocks, that their numbers were of little profit to them,
and it was an easy victory for the Macedonians. No
sooner did Darius see that the day was against him, than
he turned his chariot and fled, leaving his family to fall
into the hands of the conqueror, while he himself hastened
to Babylon to collect another army.</p>

<p>16. Alexander treated the mother, wife, and children
of Darius with great kindness and courtesy, sending an
officer to assure them of his protection, and going the
next morning to visit them, accompanied by his friend
HephÃ¦stion, a young man of his own age. Alexander,
though of beautiful and noble countenance, and well
formed for strength and activity, was rather short in stature,
and as his dress was very simple, Sisygambis mistook
HephÃ¦stion for the King of Macedon, and threw herself
on the ground before him; and she was greatly confused
and distressed when she discovered her error; but Alexander
said, as he raised her, "You were not deceived, for
he is Alexander's other self." He gave her the name of
mother, never sat down in her presence except at her request,
and showed in every point a respect and courtesy
such as she had probably never before received from the
Asiatic princes, who always held women in contempt.</p>

<p>17. Pursuing his intention of first destroying the
naval power of the Persian empire, Alexander next entered
Phoenicia, and readily received the submission of
Zidon, but Tyre refused to admit him within the walls.
New Tyre, which was built after the seventy years' desolation
which followed the conquest by Nebuchadnezzar,
stood upon an island about half a mile from the shore,
and was inhabited by a numerous and brave people, who
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
thought themselves secure from an enemy who had no
fleet to bring against them.</p>

<p>18. Alexander was, however, not to be daunted by
any difficulty. He at first attempted to build a causeway
from the shore to the island, and when the Tyrians destroyed
his works he went to Zidon and there obtained a
fleet, by means of which he at length took the city after
a seven months' siege. He stained his victory by a cruel
slaughter, and made slaves of all whose lives were spared,
excepting a few whom the Zidonians contrived to conceal
in their ships. This was the final fall of the great
merchant city, so often predicted by Isaiah and Ezekiel.</p>

<p>19. He then marched through the rest of Palestine,
intending to punish Jerusalem, which had stood loyal to
Darius, and refused to send him supplies. The Jews, on
his approach, prayed for guidance and protection, and it
was revealed to Jaddua, the high-priest, that he should
open the gates and go forth in his sacred robes to receive
the Grecian conqueror. It was accordingly done; and
Jaddua, in the vestments of Aaron, came forth at the
head of the choir of priests in white garments as Alexander
and the Greeks mounted the hill toward the city.
No sooner did the king meet the procession than he bent
down to the ground in adoration, and walked in the midst of
the priests to the temple, where a sacrifice was offered; and
he not only spared the Jews, but showed them much favor.</p>

<p>20. He told his generals that before he left Macedon
he had seen in a dream a figure exactly resembling that
of the high-priest, which had foretold all his conquests.
And surely there is little reason to doubt that such a revelation
might be made to a conqueror marked out as clearly
by prophecy as Nebuchadnezzar or Cyrus, before he
set out on the work appointed for him. Both his predecessors
in conquest, as soon as they came in contact with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the chosen people, were taught that they were the subjects
of prophecy; and Alexander, in his turn, was shown
by Jaddua the prediction of Daniel, which spoke of him
as a he-goat (the actual ensign of Macedon), "Who came
from the West, and smote the ram, and brake his two
horns, and cast him down and trampled on him." "And
the rough goat is the King of Grecia."</p>

<p>21. He then proceeded southward, besieged and took
Gaza, after a brave resistance, which he cruelly requited,
and entered Egypt, subduing it with little difficulty. On
one of the peninsulas formed by the mouth of the Nile,
he founded a city, called after his name Alexandria,
which became the capital of Egypt under its Greek rulers,
and one of the most famous cities in the world. He
made an expedition to the temple of Jupiter Ammon, on
an oasis in the Libyan desert, and consulted the oracle
there, and then after appointing a Macedonian satrap in
Egypt, retraced his steps toward the Holy Land, and
marched toward Babylonia, where Darius was again collecting
his forces to oppose him.</p>

<h2><i>XXIV.&mdash;ALEXANDER'S CONQUESTS.</i></h2>

<p>1. Alexander crossed the Euphrates and Tigris without
opposition, and the decisive battle did not take place till
he reached the plain of Arbela, where the Persians were
drawn up to receive him. The Macedonians wished to
make a night attack, but Alexander would not permit
it, saying that he disdained to steal a victory, and the
combat took place the next day.</p>

<p>2. The present army of Persians was drawn from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
more remote regions of Bactria and Parthia, where the
men were more warlike, and they fought better than
any whom the Macedonians had before encountered; but
Darius himself fled early in the day, leaving behind
him his bow and shield; his men lost courage, and followed
him, and Alexander was left master of the field of
Arbela.</p>

<p>3. This battle placed in his power all the western part
of the Persian empire, and he had only to march to the
great cities of Babylon, Susa, Ecbatana, and Persepolis,
to take possession of the huge stores of treasures there
heaped up by the Persian kings, which he now distributed
among his followers with royal bounty. The unfortunate
Darius escaped into Bactria, where two satraps, in
whom he had confided, treacherously seized him and made
him prisoner, carrying him along with them as they fled
before Alexander, until at length, being closely pressed
by the Greeks, they threw their darts at him, and left
him lying on the ground mortally wounded.</p>

<p>4. He was still alive when some of the Greeks came
up, but died before the arrival of Alexander. The conqueror
wept as he beheld the corpse of the last of a line
of such great princes; he threw his own cloak over it,
and sent it to Babylon, where it was buried with great
magnificence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="p100-illus.jpg" id="p100-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p100-illus.jpg" width="500" height="708" alt="Death of a king" title="" />
 <p class="caption2"><i>Alexander at the Dead Body of Darius.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. The wife of Darius had died a prisoner, but Sisygambis
still remained with her grandchildren at Babylon.
Only once does Alexander seem to have hurt her feelings,
and this was through ignorance of Persian customs. He
showed her some robes of his sister's own weaving and
embroidery, and offered to have her grand-daughters instructed
in the same art, at which she wept, since Persian
ladies deemed such employments work fit only for slaves
and captives, and Alexander was obliged to explain how
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 100]<br />[Pg 101]</a></span>
honorably the loom and needle were esteemed by his own
countrywomen.</p>

<p>6. Alexander was much attached to his own mother,
Olympias, and portions of his letters to her have come
down to our time. She was a proud and violent woman,
who often interfered with Antipater, governor of Macedon,
and caused him to send many complaints to the
king: "Ah!" said Alexander, "Antipater does not know
that one tear of a mother will blot out ten thousand of
his letters."</p>

<p>7. Alexander had indeed an open and affectionate
heart, but he was fast becoming too much uplifted by his
successes. On Darius's death, he took the state as well
as the title of a king of Persia, wore the tiara and robes,
and claimed from the Macedonians the same servile tokens
of homage as were paid by the eastern nations, thus causing
perpetual heart-burnings among them, since they could
neither endure to see their king exalted so much further
above them, nor to be placed on the same level with the
barbarians whom they despised.</p>

<p>8. Their jealousies troubled Alexander from the time
he assumed the tiara of Persia. He found it impossible
to raise the condition of the Persians, and treat them with
favor, without offending the Macedonians, and his temper
did not always endure these provocations. The worst
action of his life was the sentencing to death, on a false
accusation, the wise old General Parmenio, and his son;
and in a fit of passion at a riotous banquet, he slew, with
his own hand, his friend Clitus, his nurse's son, who had
saved his life at the battle of Granicus. It was the deed
of a moment of drunken violence, and he bitterly lamented
it, shutting himself up for several days without allowing
any one to approach him, and paying all honors to
the memory of his murdered friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
    9. His pride and vain-glory went so far, that he declared
that the oracle of Jupiter Ammon had announced
that he was the son of Jupiter, and sent to Greece to desire
to be enrolled among the gods in his life-time. Some
of the Greeks were shocked at his profanity, others
laughed at him; but all the Spartans said was, "If Alexander
will be a god, let him."</p>

<p>10. The next four years were the most laborious of
Alexander's life. He pursued the murderers of Darius
into Bactria and Sogdiana, avenged his death, and reduced
the numerous hill-forts as far as the frontier of
Scythia. Fierce insurrections broke out among the wild
tribes of Sogdiana, which it required all his activity and
judgment to quell, and more than once provoked him
into cruelty, though in general, conqueror as he was,
he was no spoiler, but wherever he went founded cities,
and tried to teach the Persians the civilized arts of
Greece.</p>

<p>11. In 326 he set out for India, as the region was
called round the river Indus. Here the inhabitants were
warlike, and Porus, king of a portion of the country,
made a brave resistance, but was at length defeated and
taken prisoner. On being brought before Alexander he
said he had nothing to ask, save to be treated as a king.
"That I shall do for my own sake," said Alexander, and
accordingly not only set him at liberty, but enlarged his
territory.</p>

<p>12. All these Indian nations brought a tribute of elephants,
which the Macedonians now for the first time
learned to employ in war. Alexander wished to proceed
into Hindostan, a country hitherto entirely unknown, but
his soldiers grew so discontented at the prospect of being
led so much farther from home, into the utmost parts of
the earth, that he was obliged to give up his attempt, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
very unwillingly turned back from the banks of the Sutlej.</p>

<p>13. While returning, he besieged a little town belonging
to a tribe called the Malli, and believed to be the
present city of Mooltan. He was the first to scale the
wall, and after four others had mounted, the ladder broke,
and he was left standing on the wall, a mark for the darts
of the enemy. He instantly leaped down within the wall
into the midst of the Malli, and there setting his back
against a fig-tree, defended himself until a barbed arrow
deeply pierced his breast, and, after trying to keep up a
little longer, he sunk, fainting, on his shield. His four
companions sprung down after him&mdash;two were slain, but
the others held their shields over him till the rest of the
army succeeded in breaking into the town and coming to
the rescue.</p>

<p>14. His wound was severe and dangerous, but he at
length recovered, sailed down to the mouth of the Indus,
and sent a fleet to survey the Persian Gulf, while he himself
marched along the shore. The country was bare and
desert, and his army suffered dreadfully from heat, thirst,
and hunger, while he readily shared all their privations.
A little water was once brought him on a parching day,
as a great prize, but since there was not enough for all,
he poured it out on the sand, lest his faithful followers
should feel themselves more thirsty when they saw him
drink alone.</p>

<p>15. At last he safely arrived at Caramania, whence
he returned to the more inhabited and wealthy parts of
Persia, held his court with great magnificence at Susa,
and then went to Babylon. Here embassies met him
from every part of the known world, bringing gifts and
homage, and above all, there arrived from the Greek
states the much desired promise that he should be honored
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
as a god. He was at the highest pitch of worldly
greatness to which mortal man had yet attained, and his
designs were reaching yet further; but his hour was come,
and at Babylon, the home of pride, "the great horn" was
to be broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
    16. In the marshes into which the Euphrates had
spread since its channel was altered by Cyrus, there
breathed a noxious air, and a few weeks after Alexander's
arrival, he was attacked by a fever, perhaps increased by
intemperance. He bore up against it as long as possible,
continued to offer sacrifices daily, though with increasing
difficulty, and summoned his officers to arrange plans for
his intended expedition; but his strength failed him on
the ninth day, and though he called them together as
usual, he could not address them. Perhaps he thought
in that hour of the prophecy he had seen at Jerusalem,
that the empire he had toiled to raise should be divided,
for he is reported to have said that there would be a
mighty contest at his funeral games. He made no attempt
to name a successor, but he took off his signet-ring,
placed it on the finger of Perdiccas, one of his generals,
and a short time after expired, in the thirty-third year of
his age, and the twelfth of his reign.</p>

<p>17. There was a voice of wailing throughout the city
that night. The Babylonians shut up their houses, and
trembled at the neighborhood of the fierce Greek soldiery,
now that their protector was dead; the Macedonians
stood to arms all night, as if in presence of the
enemy; and when in the morning the officers assembled
in the palace council chamber, bitter and irrepressible was
the burst of lamentation that broke out at the sight of
the vacant throne, where lay the crown, scepter, and royal
robes, and where Perdiccas now placed the signet-ring.
More deeply than all mourned the prisoner, the aged
Sisygambis, who covered her face with a black veil, sat
down in a corner of her room, refused all entreaties to
speak or to eat, and expired five days after Alexander.</p>

<p>18. Nor did the Persians soon cease to lament the conqueror,
who had ruled them more beneficently than their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
own monarchs had done; their traditions made Alexander
a prince of their own, and adorned him with every
virtue valued in the East. That he had many great faults
has already been shown, and, of course, by the rules of
justice, his conquests were but reckless gratifications of
his own ambition; but he was a high-minded, generous
man, open of heart, free of hand, and for the most part
acting up to his knowledge of right; and if unbridled
power, talent of the highest order, and glory such as none
before or since has ever attained, inflamed his passions,
and elated him with pride, still it is not for us to judge
severely of one who had such great temptations, and so
little to guide him aright.</p>

<h2><i>XXV.&mdash;JUDAS MACCABÃUS, THE HEBREW<br />
WILLIAM TELL.</i></h2>

<p>1. The kingdom of Judah escaped destruction at the
hands of Sennacherib, but its respite was short. Soon
afterward Babylon, closely related to Assyria, and the
heir of its dominion, swept into captivity in distant
Mesopotamia nearly all that were left of Hebrew stock.
For a time, the nation seemed to have been wiped from
the face of the earth. The ten tribes of Israel that had
been first dragged forth never returned to Judea, and
their ultimate fate, after the destruction of Nineveh,
whose splendor they had in their servitude done so much
to enhance, was that of homeless wanderers. The harp
of Judah, silent upon the devastated banks of the Jordan,
was hung upon the Babylonian willows, for how could
the exiles sing the Lord's song in a strange land! But
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the cry went forth at length that Babylon had fallen in
her turn, just as destruction had before overtaken Nineveh.
In the middle of the sixth century <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, Cyrus the
Mede made a beginning of restoring the exiles, who
straightway built anew the Temple walls.</p>

<p>2. In David's time, the population of Palestine must
have numbered several millions, and it largely increased
during the succeeding reigns. Multitudes, however, had
perished by the sword, and other multitudes were retained
in strange lands. Scarcely fifty thousand found
their way back in the time of Cyrus to the desolate site
of Jerusalem, but, one hundred years later, the number
was increased by a re-enforcement under Ezra. From
this nucleus, with astonishing vitality, a new Israel was
presently developed. With weapons always at hand to
repel the freebooters of the desert, they constructed once
more the walls of Jerusalem. Through all their harsh
experience their feelings of nationality had not been at
all abated; their blood was untouched by foreign admixture,
though some Gentile ideas had entered into the substance
of their faith. The conviction that they were the
chosen people of God was as unshaken as in the ancient
time. With pride as indomitable as ever, intrenched
within their little corner of Syria, they confronted the
hostile world.</p>

<p>3. But a new contact was at hand, far more memorable
even than that with the nations of Mesopotamia&mdash;a
contact whose consequences affect at the present hour
the condition of the greater part of the human race. In
the year 332 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, the high-priest, Jaddua, at Jerusalem,
was in an agony, not knowing how he should meet certain
new invaders of the land, before whom Tyre, and
Gaza, the old Philistine stronghold, had fallen, and who
were now marching upon the city of David. But God
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
warned him in a dream that he should take courage,
adorn the city, and open the gates; that the people should
appear in white garments of peace, but that he and the
priests should meet the strangers in the robes of their
office. At length, at the head of a sumptuous train of
generals and tributary princes, a young man of twenty-four,
upon a beautiful steed, rode forward from the way
going down to the sea to the spot which may still be seen,
called, anciently, Scopus, the prospect, because from that
point one approaching could behold, for the first time,
Jerusalem crowned by the Temple rising fair upon the
heights of Zion and Moriah.</p>

<p>4. The youth possessed a beauty of a type in those
regions hitherto little known. As compared with the
swarthy Syrians in his suite, his skin was white; his features
were stamped with the impress of command, his
eyes filled with an intellectual light. With perfect horsemanship
he guided the motions of his charger. A fine
grace marked his figure, set off with a cloak, helmet, and
gleaming arms, as he expressed with animated gestures
his exultation over the spectacle before him. But now,
down from the heights came the procession of the priests
and the people. The multitude proceeded in their robes
of white; the priests stood clothed in fine linen; while
the high-priest, in attire of purple and scarlet, upon his
breast the great breastplate of judgment with its jewels,
upon his head the mitre marked with the plate of gold
whereon was engraved the name of God, led the train
with venerable dignity.</p>

<p>5. Now, says the historian, when the Ph&oelig;nicians and
Chaldeans that followed Alexander thought that they
should have liberty to plunder the city, and torment the
high-priest to death, the very reverse happened; for the
young leader, when he saw the multitude in the distance,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and the figure of the high-priest before, approached him
by himself, saluted him, and adored the name, which was
graven upon the plate of the mitre. Then a captain,
named Parmino, asked him how it came to pass that,
when all others adored him, he should adore the high-priest
of the Jews. To whom the leader replied: "I do
not adore him, but that God who hath honored him with
his high-priesthood; for I saw this very person in a
dream, in this very habit, when I was at Dios in Macedonia,
who, when I was considering how I might obtain
the dominion of Asia, exhorted me to make no delay, but
boldly to pass over the sea thither, for that he would
conduct my army, and could give me the dominion over
the Persians." Then, when Alexander had given the
high-priest his right hand, the priests ran along by him
and he came into the city, and he offered sacrifice to God
in the Temple, according to the high-priest's direction,
and magnificently treated both the high-priest and the
priests. He granted all the multitude desired; and when
he said to them that if any of them would enlist themselves
in his army on this condition, that they should continue
under the laws of their forefathers, he was willing
to take them with him, many were ready to accompany
him in his wars.</p>

<p>6. But this Aryan troop that went southward is less
interesting to us than companies that departed westward,
for in these westward marching bands went the primeval
forefathers from whose venerable loins we ourselves have
proceeded. They passed into Western Asia, and from
Asia into Europe&mdash;each migrating multitude impelled
by a new swarm sent forth from the parent hive behind.
At the head of the Adriatic Sea an Aryan troop had
divided, sending down into the eastern peninsula the ancestors
of the Greeks, and into the western peninsula
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the train destined to establish upon the seven hills the
power of Rome. Already the Aryan pioneers, the Celts,
on the outmost rocks of the western coast of Europe,
were fretting against the barrier of storm and sea, across
which they were not to find their way for many ages.
Already Ph&oelig;nician merchants, trading for amber in the
far-off Baltic, had become aware of the wild Aryan tribes
pressing to the northwest&mdash;the Teutons and Goths. Already,
perhaps, upon the outlying spur of the Ural range,
still other Aryans had fixed their hold, the progenitors of
the Sclav. The aboriginal savage of Europe was already
nearly extinct. His lance of flint had fallen harmless
from the Aryan buckler; his rude altars had become displaced
by the shrines of the new gods. In the Mediterranean
Sea each sunny isle and pleasant promontory had
long been in Aryan hands, and now in the wintry forests
to the northward the resistless multitudes had more recently
fixed their seats.</p>

<p>7. In the Macedonians, the Aryans, having established
their dominion in Europe, march back upon the track
which their forefathers long before had followed westward;
and now it is that the Hebrews become involved
with the race that from that day to this has been the master-race
of the world. It was a contact taking place under
circumstances, it would seem, the most auspicious&mdash;the
venerable old man and the beautiful Greek youth clasping
hands, the ruthless followers of the conqueror baffled in
their hopes of booty, the multitudes of Jerusalem, in
their robes of peace, filling the air with acclamations, as
Alexander rode from the place of prospect, upon the
heights of Zion, into the solemn precincts of the Temple.</p>

<p>8. The successors of Alexander the Great made the
Jews a link between the Hellenic populations that had
become widely scattered throughout the East by the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Macedonian conquests, and the great barbarian races
among whom the Greeks had placed themselves. The dispersion
of the Jews, which had already taken place to such
an extent through the Assyrian and Babylonian conquests,
went forward now more vigorously. Throughout Western
Asia they were found everywhere, but it was in
Egypt that they attained the highest prosperity and honor.
The one city, Alexandria alone, is said to have contained
at length a million Jews, whom the Greek kings
of Egypt, the Ptolemies, preferred in every way to the
native population. Elsewhere, too, they were favored,
and hence they were everywhere hated; and the hatred
assumed a deeper bitterness from the fact that the Jew
always remained a Jew, marked in garb, in feature, in
religious faith, always scornfully asserting the claim that
he was the chosen of the Lord. Palestine became incorporated
with the empire of the SeleucidÃ¦, the Macedonian
princes to whom had fallen Western Asia. Oppression
at last succeeded the earlier favor, the defenses of
Jerusalem were demolished, and the Temple defiled with
pagan ceremonies; and now it is that we reach some of
the finest figures in Hebrew history, the great high-priests,
the Maccabees.</p>

<p>9. There dwelt at the town of Modin a priest, Mattathias,
the descendant of AsmonÃ¦us, to whom had been
born five sons&mdash;John, Simon, Judas MaccabÃ¦us, or the
Hammer, Eleazar, and Jonathan. Mattathias lamented
the ravaging of the land and the plunder of the Temple
by Antiochus Epiphanes, and when, in the year 167 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>,
the Macedonian king sent to Modin to have sacrifices
offered, the AsmonÃ¦an returned a spirited reply. "Thou
art a ruler," said the king's officers, "and an honorable
and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons
and brethren. Now, therefore, come thou first: so shalt
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
thou and thy house be in number of the king's friends,
and thou and thy children shall be honored with silver
and gold and many rewards." But Mattathias replied
with a loud voice: "Though all the nations that are under
the king's dominions obey him, and fall away every one
from the religion of their fathers, yet will I and my sons
and my brethren, walk in the covenant of our fathers.
God forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances!
We will not hearken to the king's words to go
from our religion, either on the right hand or the left."</p>

<p>10. An heroic struggle for freedom at once began,
which opened for the Jews full of sadness. An apostate
Jew, approaching to offer sacrifice in compliance with the
command of Antiochus, was at once slain by Mattathias,
who struck down also Apelles, the king's general, with
some of his soldiers. As he fled with his sons into the
desert, leaving his substance behind him, many of the
faithful Israelites followed, pursued by the Macedonians
seeking revenge. The oppressors knew well how to choose
their time. Attacking on the Sabbath-day, when, according
to old tradition, it was a transgression even to defend
one's life, a thousand with their wives and children were
burned and smothered in the caves in which they had
taken refuge. But Mattathias, rallying those that remained,
taught them to fight on the Sabbath, and at all
times. The heathen altars were overthrown, the breakers
of the law were slain, the uncircumcised boys were everywhere
circumcised. But the fullness of time approached
for Mattathias; after a year his day of death had come,
and these were his parting words to his sons: "I know
that your brother Simon is a man of counsel; give ear
unto him always; he shall be a father unto you. As for
Judas MaccabÃ¦us, he hath been mighty and strong even
from his youth up; let him be your captain and fight
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the battles of the people. Admit among you the righteous."</p>

<p>11. No sooner had the father departed, than it appeared
that the captain whom he had designated was a
man as mighty as the great champions of old, Joshua and
Gideon and Samson. He forthwith smote with defeat
Apollonius, the general in the Samaritan country, and
when he had slain the Greek he took his sword for his
own. Seron, general of the army in C&oelig;le-Syria, came
against him with a host of Macedonians strengthened by
apostate Jews. The men of Judas MaccabÃ¦us were few
in number, without food, and faint-hearted, but he inspired
them with his own zeal, and overthrew the new
foes at Bethoron. King Antiochus, being now called
eastward to Persia, committed military matters in Palestine
to the viceroy, Lysias, with orders to take an army
with elephants and conquer Judea, enslave its people,
destroy Jerusalem, and abolish the nation. At once the
new invaders were upon the land; of foot-soldiers there
were forty thousand, of horsemen seven thousand, and as
they advanced many Syrians and renegade Jews joined
them. Merchants marched with the army, with money
to buy the captives as slaves, and chains with which to
bind those whom they purchased. But Judas MaccabÃ¦us
was no whit dismayed. Causing his soldiers to array
themselves in sackcloth, he made them pray to Jehovah.
He dismissed those lately married, and those who had
newly come into great possessions, as likely to be faint-hearted.
After addressing those that remained, he set
them in the ancient order of battle, and waited the opportunity
to strike.</p>

<p>12. The hostile general, fancying he saw an opportunity
to surprise the little band of Hebrews, sent a portion
of his host against them, by secret ways at night.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
But the spies of Judas were out. Leaving the fires burning
brightly in his camp, to lure forward those who were
commissioned to attack him, he rushed forth under the
shadows against the main body, weakened by the absence
of the detachment. He forced their position, though
strongly defended, overcame the army; then turned back
to scatter utterly the other party who were seeking him
in the abandoned camp. He took great booty of gold
and silver, and of raiment purple and blue. He marched
home in great joy to the villages of Judea, singing hymns
to God, as was done in the days of Miriam, long before,
because they had triumphed gloriously.</p>

<p>13. The next year Lysias advanced from Antioch, the
Syrian capital, with a force of sixty-five thousand. Judas
MaccabÃ¦us, with ten thousand, overthrew his vanguard,
upon which the viceroy, terrified at the desperate fighting,
retired to assemble a still greater army. For a time there
was a respite from war, during which Judas counseled
the people to purify the Temple. The Israelites, overjoyed
at the revival of their ancient customs, the restoration
of the old worship in all its purity, and the relief from
foreign oppressors, celebrated for eight days a magnificent
festival. The lamps in the Temple porches were rekindled
to the sound of instruments and the chant of the
Levites. But one vial of oil could be found, when, lo, a
miracle! the one vial sufficed for the supply of the seven-branched
golden candlestick for a week. This ancient
MaccabÃ¦an festival faithful Jews still celebrate under the
name of the Hanoukhah, the Feast of Lights.</p>

<p>14. Judas subdues also the Idumeans of the southward,
and the Ammonites. His brethren, too, have become
mighty men of valor. Jonathan crosses the Jordan
with him and campaigns against the tribes to the eastward.
Eleazar is a valiant soldier, and Simon carries
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
succor to the Jews in Galilee. But at length the Macedonian
is again at hand, more terrible than before. The
foot are a hundred thousand, the horse twenty thousand;
and as rallying-points, thirty-two elephants tower among
the ranks. About each one of the huge beasts is collected
a troop of a thousand foot and five hundred horse;
high turrets upon their backs are occupied by archers;
their great flanks and limbs are cased in plates of steel.
The host show their golden and brazen shields, making
in the sun a glorious splendor, and shout in exultation so
that the mountains echo. In the battle that follows Fortune
does not altogether favor the Jews. In particular,
the champion Eleazar lays down his life. He had attacked
the largest elephant, a creature covered with plated
armor, and carrying upon his back a whole troop of combatants,
among whom it was believed that the king himself
fought. Eleazar had slain those in the neighborhood,
then, creeping beneath the belly of the elephant, had
pierced him. As the brute fell, Eleazar was crushed in
the fall. Judas was forced to retire within the defenses
of Jerusalem, where still further disaster seemed likely to
overcome him. Dissensions among themselves, however,
weakened the Macedonians. Peace was offered the Jews,
and permission to live according to the law of their fathers&mdash;proposals
which were gladly accepted, although the
invaders razed the defenses of the Temple.</p>

<p>15. The peace was not enduring. New Macedonian
invasions followed; new Hebrew successes, the Maccabees
and their partisans making up, by their fierce zeal, their
military skill, and dauntless valor, for their want of numbers.
But a sad day came at last. Judas, twenty times
outnumbered, confronts the leader Bacchides in Galilee.
The Greek sets horsemen on both wings, his light troops
and archers before the heavier phalanx, and takes his own
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
station on the right. The Jewish hero is valiant as ever;
the right wing of the enemy turns to flee. The left and
center, however, encompass him, and he falls, fighting
gloriously, having earned a name of the most skillful and
valorous of the world's great vindicators of freedom.</p>

<h2>ROMAN RECORD.</h2>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2><i>XXVI.&mdash;TARQUIN THE WICKED.</i></h2>

<p>1. For his tyranny King Tarquin was banished from
Rome about 500 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, and after his expulsion he sent
messengers to Rome to ask that his property should be
given up to him, and the senate decreed that his prayer
should be granted. But the king's ambassadors, while
they were in Rome, stirred up the minds of the young
men and others who had been favored by Tarquin, so
that a plot was made to bring him back. Among those
who plotted were Titus and Tiberius, the sons of the
consul Brutus; and they gave letters to the messengers
of the king. But it chanced that a certain slave hid himself
in the place where they met, and overheard them
plotting; and he came and told the thing to the consuls,
who seized the messengers of the king with the letters
upon their persons, authenticated by the seals of the
young men. The culprits were immediately arrested;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
but the ambassadors were let go, because their persons
were regarded as sacred. And the goods of King Tarquin
were given up for plunder to the people.</p>

<p>2. Then the traitors were brought up before the consuls,
and the sight was such as to move all beholders to
pity; for among them were the sons of Lucius Junius
Brutus himself, the first consul, the liberator of the Roman
people. And now all men saw how Brutus loved
his country; for he bade the lictors put all the traitors to
death, and his own sons first; and men could mark in his
face the struggle between his duty as a chief magistrate
of Rome and his feelings as a father. And while they
praised and admired him they pitied him yet more. This
was the first attempt to restore Tarquin the Proud.</p>

<p>3. When Tarquin saw that the plot at home had failed,
he prevailed on the people of Tarquinii and Veii to make
war with him against the Romans. But the consuls came
out against them; Valerius commanding the main army,
and Brutus the cavalry. And it chanced that Aruns, the
king's son, led the cavalry of the enemy. When he saw
Brutus, he spurred his horse against him, and Brutus did
not decline the combat. They rode straight at each other
with leveled spears; and so fierce was the shock, that
they pierced each other through from breast to back, and
both fell dead.</p>

<p>4. Then, also, the armies fought, but the battle was
neither won nor lost. But in the night a voice was heard
by the Etruscans, saying that the Romans were the conquerers.
So the enemy fled by night; and when the Romans
arose in the morning, there was no man to oppose
them. Then they took up the body of Brutus, and departed
home, and buried him in public with great pomp.</p>

<p>5. And thus the second attempt to restore King Tarquin
was frustrated. After the death of Brutus, Valerius,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the remaining consul, ruled the people for awhile by himself,
and began to build himself a house upon the ridge
called Velia, which looks down upon the forum. So the
people thought that he was going to make himself king;
but when he heard this, he called an assembly of the
people, and appeared before them with his fasces lowered,
and with no axes in them, whence the custom remained
ever after, that no consular lictors wore axes
within the city, and no consul had power of life and
death except when he was in command of his legions
abroad. And he pulled down the beginning of his house
upon the Velia, and built it below that hill. Also, he
passed laws that every Roman citizen might appeal to the
people against the judgment of the chief magistrates.
Wherefore he was greatly honored among the people, and
was called <i>Poplicola</i>, or <i>Friend of the People</i>.</p>

<p>6. After this Valerius called together the great assembly
of the centuries, and they chose Spurius Lucretius,
father of Lucretius, to succeed Brutus. But he was an
old man, and not many days afterward he died, and
Marcus Horatius was chosen in his stead.</p>

<p>7. The temple on the Capitol which King Tarquin
began had never yet been consecrated. Then Valerius
and Horatius drew lots which should be the consecrator,
and the lot fell on Horatius. But the friends of Valerius
murmured, and they wished to prevent Horatius
from having the honor; so, when he was now saying the
prayer of consecration, with his hand upon the door-post
of the temple, there came a messenger who told him that
his son was just dead, and that one mourning for a son
could not rightly consecrate the temple. But Horatius
kept his hand upon the door-post, and told them to see to
the burial of his son, and finished the rite of consecration.
Thus did he honor the gods even above his own son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
    8. In the next year Valerius was again made consul,
with Titus Lucretius; and Tarquin, despairing now of
aid from his friends at Veii and Tarquinii, went to Lars
Porsena of Clusium, a city on the river Clanis, which falls
into the Tiber. Porsena was, at this time, acknowledged
as chief of the twelve Etruscan cities; and he assembled
a powerful army and came to Rome. He came so quickly
that he reached the Tiber, and was near the Sublician
Bridge before there was time to destroy it; and if he had
crossed it the city would have been lost.</p>

<p>9. Then, a noble Roman, called Horatius Cocles, of
the Lucerian tribe, with two friends&mdash;Spurius Lartius, a
Ramnian, and Titus Herminius, a Titian&mdash;posted themselves
at the far end of the bridge, and defended the passage
against all the Etruscan host, while the Romans were
cutting it off behind them. When it was all but destroyed,
his two friends retreated across the bridge, and
Horatius was left alone to bear the whole attack of the
enemy. He kept his ground, standing unmoved amid
the darts which were showered upon his shield, till the
last beams of the bridge fell crashing into the river.
Then he prayed, saying, "Father Tiber, receive me, and
bear me up I pray thee." He then plunged in, and
reached the other side safely; and the Romans honored
him greatly: they put up his statue in the Comitium, and
gave him as much land as he could plow round in a day,
and every man at Rome subscribed the cost of one day's
food to reward him.</p>

<div class="signature"><i>Liddell.</i></div>

<p>10. This story is told in very spirited verse by Macaulay,
in his poem of Horatius:</p>

<h2><i>XXVII.-THE ROMAN REPUBLIC.</i></h2>

<p>1. The establishment of the republic marked an era
in the history of Rome. The people had decreed, that
for them there never should be a king, and the law was
kept to the letter; though, if they meant that supreme
authority should never be held among them by one man,
it was violated many times. The story of Rome is unique
in the history of the world, for it is not the record of the
life of one great country, but of a city that grew to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
strong, and successfully established its authority over many
countries.</p>

<p>2. The most ancient and the most remote from the
sea of the cities of Latium, Rome soon became the most
influential, and began to combine in itself the traits of
the peoples near it; but owing to the singular strength
and rare impressiveness of the national character, these
were assimilated, and the inhabitant of the capital remained
distinctively a Roman in spite of his intimate association
with men of different origin and training.</p>

<p>3. The citizen of Rome was practical, patriotic, and
faithful to obligation; he loved to be governed by inflexible
law; and it was a fundamental principle with him
that the individual should be subordinate to the state.
His kings were either organizers, like Numa and Ancus-Marcius,
or warriors like Romulus and Tullus Hostilius;
they either made laws, like Servius, or they enforced
them with the despotism of Tarquinius Superbus. It is
difficult for us to conceive of such majestic power emanating
from a territory so insignificant.</p>

<p>4. We hardly realize that Latium did not comprise a
territory quite fifty miles by one hundred in extent, and
that it was but a hundred miles from the Mediterranean
to the Adriatic. It was but a short walk from Rome to
the territory of the Etruscans, and when Tarquin found
an asylum at CÃ¦re, he did not separate himself by twenty
miles from the scene of his tyranny. Ostia was scarcely
more distant, and one might have ridden before the first
meal of the day to Lavinium, or Alba, or Veii, or to Ardea,
the ancient city of the Rutuli. It is important to
keep these facts in mind as we read the story of the remarkable
city.</p>

<p>5. All towns were built on hills in these early days,
for safety in case of war, as well as because the valleys
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
were insalubrious, but this was not a peculiarity of the
Romans, for in New England in the late ages of our own
ancestors, they were obliged to follow the same custom.
On the tops and slopes of seven hills, as they liked to remind
themselves, the Romans built their city. They were
not impressive elevations, though their sides were sharp
and rocky, for the loftiest rose less than three hundred
feet above the sea-level. Their summits were crowned
with groves of beech trees and oaks, and in the lower
lands grew osiers and other smaller varieties.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="caption2"><i>Ancient Roman Monument.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. The earlier occupations of the Roman people were
war and agriculture, or the pasturage of flocks and herds.
They raised grapes and made wines; they cultivated the
oil-olive, and knew the use of its fruit. They found copper
in their soil, and made a pound of it their unit of
value, but it was so cheap that ten thousand pounds of it
were required to buy a war-horse, though cattle and sheep
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
were much lower. They yoked their oxen and called the
path they occupied a <i>jugerum</i> (<i>jugum</i>&mdash;a cross-beam or
a yoke), and this in time came to be their familiar standard
of square measure, containing about two-thirds of an
acre. Two of these were assigned to a citizen, and seven
were the narrow limit to which only one's landed possessions
were for a long time allowed to extend. In time
commerce was added to the pursuits of the men, and with
it came fortunes and improved dwellings, and public
buildings. Laziness and luxury were frowned upon by
the early Romans. Mistress and maid worked together
in the affairs of the household, like Lucretia and other
noble women of whom history tells, and the man did not
hesitate to hold the plow, as the example of Cincinnatus
will show us. Time was precious, and thrift and economy
were necessary to success. The father was the autocrat in
the household, and exercised his power with stern rigidity.</p>

<p>7. Art was backward, and came from abroad; of literature
there was none, long after Greece had passed its period
of heroic poetry. The dwellings of the citizens were
low and insignificant, though, as time passed on, they
became more massive and important. The vast public
structures of the later kings were comparable to the taskwork
of the builders of the Egyptian pyramids, and they
still strike us with astonishment, and surprise.</p>

<p>8. The religion of these strong conquerors was narrow,
severe, and dreary. The early fathers worshiped
native deities only. They recognized gods everywhere&mdash;in
the home, in the grove, and on the mountain. They
erected their altars on the hills; they had their lares and
penates to watch over their hearth-stones, and their vestal
virgins kept everlasting vigil near the never-dying fires in
the temples. With the art of Greece that made itself felt
through Etruria, came also the influence of the Grecian
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
mythology, and Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva found a shrine
on the top of the Capitoline, where the first statue of a
deity was erected. The mysterious sibylline books are
also a mark of the Grecian influence, coming from CumÃ¦,
a colony of Magna GrÃ¦cia.</p>

<p>9. During the period we have considered, the city
passed through five distinct stages of political organization.
The government at first was an elective monarchy,
the electors being a patriarchal aristocracy. After the
invasion of the Sabines there was a union with that people,
the sovereignty being held by rulers chosen from each, but
it was not long before Rome became the head of a federal
state. The Tarquins established a monarchy, which rapidly
degenerated into an offensive tyranny, which aroused
rebellion and at last led to the republic.</p>

<p>10. During all these changes, the original aristocrats
and their descendants held their position as the Populus
Romanus, the Roman people, insisting that every one
else must belong to an inferior order, and, as no body of
men is willing to be condemned to a hopelessly subordinate
position in a state, there was a perpetual antagonism
between the patricians and the plebeians, between the
aristocracy and the commonalty. This led to a temporary
change under Servius Tullius, when property took
the place of pedigree in establishing a man's rank and influence;
but owing to the peculiar method of voting
adopted, the power of the commons was not greatly increased.
However, they had made their influence felt, and
were encouraged.</p>

<p>11. The overturning of the scheme by Tarquin favored a
union of the two orders for the punishment of that tyrant,
and they combined; but it was only for a time. When
the danger had been removed, the tie was found broken
and the antagonism rather increased, so that the subsequent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
history for five generations, though exceedingly
interesting, is largely a record of the struggles of the
commons for relief from the burdens laid upon them by
the aristocrats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="caption2"><i>Roman Private Life.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. The father passed down to his son the story of
the oppression of the patricians, and the son told the same
sad narrative to his offspring. The mother mourned
with her daughter over the sufferings brought upon them
by the rich, for whom their poor father and brothers were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
obliged to fight the battles, while they were not allowed
to share the spoil, nor to divide the lands gained by their
own prowess. The struggle was not so much between
patrician and plebeian as between the rich and the poor.
It was intimately connected with the uses of money in
those times. What could the rich Roman do with his
accumulations? He might buy land or slaves, or he
might become a lender; to a certain extent he could use
his surplus in commerce; but of these its most remunerative
employment was found in usury. As there were no
laws regulating the rates of interest, they became exorbitant,
and as it was customary to compound it, debts rapidly
grew beyond the possibility of payment. As the
rich made the laws they naturally exerted their ingenuity
to frame them in such a way as to enable the lender to
collect his dues with promptness and with little regard
for the feelings or interests of the debtor.</p>

<p>13. It is difficult, if not impossible, for us to form a
proper conception of the magnitude of the wrongs involved
in the system of money-lending at Rome during
the period of the republic. The small farmers were ever
needy, and came to their wealthy neighbors for accommodation
loans. If these were not paid when due, the
debtor was liable to be locked up in prison, to be sold
into slavery, with his children, wife, and grandchildren;
and the heartless law reads, that in case the estate should
prove insufficient to satisfy all claims, the creditors were
actually authorized to cut the body to pieces, that each
Shylock might take the pound of flesh that he claimed.</p>

<p>14. At last the severity of the lenders overreached itself.
It was in the year 495 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, that a poor but brave debtor,
one who had been at the very front in the wars, broke
out of his prison, and while the wind flaunted his rags in
the face of the populace, clanked his chains and told the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
story of his calamities so effectually in words of natural
eloquence, that the commons were aroused to madness,
and resolved at last to make a vigorous effort, and seek
redress for their wrongs in a way that could not be resisted.</p>

<p>15. The form of this man stands out forever on the
pages of Roman history, as he entered the forum with all
the badges of his misery upon him. His pale and emaciated
body was but partially covered by his wretched tatters;
his long hair played about his shoulders, and his
glaring eyes and the grizzled beard hanging down before
him added to his savage wildness. As he passed along
he uncovered the scars of near two score battles that remained
upon his breast, and explained to inquirers that
while he had been serving in the Sabine war, his house
had been pillaged and burned by the enemy; that when
he had returned to enjoy the sweets of the peace he had
helped to win, he had found that his cattle had been
driven off, and a tax imposed.</p>

<p>16. To meet the debts that thronged upon him and
the interest by which they were aggravated, he had
stripped himself of his ancestral farms. Finally, pestilence
had overtaken him, and as he was not able to work,
his creditor had placed him in a house of detention, the
savage treatment in which was shown by the fresh stripes
upon his bleeding back.</p>

<p>17. At the moment a war was imminent, and the
forum&mdash;the entire city, in fact&mdash;already excited, was
filled with the uproar of the angry plebeians. Many confined
for debt broke from their prison-houses and ran
from all quarters into the crowds to claim protection.
The majesty of the consuls was insufficient to preserve
order, and while the discord was rapidly increasing horsemen
rushed into the gates announcing that an enemy was
actually upon them, marching to besiege the city. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
plebeians saw that their opportunity had arrived, and
when proud Appius Claudius called upon them to enroll
their names for the war, they refused the summons, saying
that the patricians might fight their own battles; that
for themselves it was better to perish together at home
rather than to go to the field and die separated.</p>

<p>18. Threatened with war beyond the gates, and with
riot at home, the patricians were forced to promise to redress
the civil grievances. It was ordered that no one
could seize or sell the goods of a soldier while he was in
camp, or arrest his children, and that no one should detain
a citizen in prison or in chains, so as to hinder him
from enlisting in the army. When this was known, the
released prisoners volunteered in numbers, and entered
upon the war with enthusiasm. The legions were victorious,
and when peace was declared, the plebeians anxiously
looked for the ratification of the promises made to them.</p>

<p>19. Their expectations were disappointed. They had,
however, seen their power, and were determined to act
upon their new knowledge. Without undue haste they
protected their homes on the Aventine, and retreated the
next year to a mountain across the Anio, about three
miles from the city, to a spot which afterward held a
place in the memories of the Romans similar to that
which the green meadow on the Thames called Runnymede
has held in British history since the June day when
King John met his commons there, and gave them the
great charter of their liberties.</p>

<p>20. The plebeians said calmly that they would no
longer be imposed upon; that not one of them would
thereafter enlist for a war until the public faith was made
good. They reiterated the declaration that the lords
might fight their own battles, so that the perils of conflict
should lie where its advantages were. When the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
situation of affairs was thoroughly understood, Rome was
on fire with anxiety, and the enforced suspense filled the
citizens with fear lest an external enemy should take the
opportunity for a successful onset upon the city.</p>

<p>21. Meanwhile the poor secessionists fortified their
camp, but carefully refrained from actual war. The people
left in the city feared the senators, and the senators
in turn dreaded the citizens lest they should do them violence.
It was a time of panic and suspense. After consultation,
good counsels prevailed in the senate, and it
was resolved to send an embassy to the despised and downtrodden
plebeians, who now seemed to hold the balance of
power, and to treat for peace, for there could be no security
until the secessionists had returned to their homes.</p>

<p>22. The spokesman on the occasion was Menenius
Agrippa Lanatus who was popular with the people and
had a reputation for eloquence. The address of this
good man had its desired effect, and the people were at
last willing to listen to a proposition for their return. It
was settled that there should be a general release of all
those who had been handed over to their creditors, and
a cancelling of debts, and that two of the plebeians should
be selected as their protectors, with power to veto objectionable
laws, their persons being as inviolable at all times
as were those of the sacred messengers of the gods.
These demands, showing that the plebeians did not seek
political power, were agreed to, the Valerian laws were
reaffirmed, and a solemn treaty was concluded, each party
swearing for itself and its posterity, with all the formality
of representatives of foreign nations.</p>

<p>23. The two leaders of the commons, Caius Licinius
and Lucius Albinus, were elected the first tribunes of
the people, as the new officers were called, with two
Ã¦diles to aid them. They were not to leave the city
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
during their term of office, their doors being open
night and day, that all who needed their protection might
have <a name="access" id="access"></a>access to them. The hill upon which this treaty
had been concluded was ever after known as the Sacred
Mount; its top was enclosed and consecrated, an altar
being built upon it, on which sacrifices were offered to
Jupiter, the god of terror and deliverance, who had allowed
the commons to return home in safety, though
they had gone out in trepidation. Henceforth the commons
were to be protected; they were better fitted to
share the honors as well as the benefits of their country,
and the threatened dissolution of the nation was averted.</p>

<h2><i>XXVIII.&mdash;CINCINNATUS.</i></h2>

<p>1. In the course of the early Roman wars, Minucius,
one of the consuls suffered himself to be cut off from
Rome, in a narrow valley of Mount Algidus, and it
seemed as if hope of delivery there was none. However,
five horsemen found means to escape and report at
Rome the perilous condition of the consul and his army.
Then the other consul consulted the senate, and it was
agreed that the only man who could deliver the army
was Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. He was thereupon
named dictator, and deputies were sent to acquaint him
with his high dignity.</p>

<p>2. He was called Cincinnatus, because he wore his
hair in long curling locks, <i>cincinni</i>, and, though he was a
patrician he lived on his own small farm, like any plebeian
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
yeoman. This farm was beyond the Tiber, and here he
lived contentedly with his wife Racilia.</p>

<p>3. Two years before he had been consul, and had
been brought into great distress by the conduct of his
son, KÃ¦so. This KÃ¦so was a Wild and insolent young
man, who despised the plebeians and hated their tribunes.
One Volscius Fictor alleged that he and his brother, an
old and sickly man, had been attacked by KÃ¦so and a
party of young patricians by night, and that his brother
had died of the treatment then received. The indignation
of the people rose high; and KÃ¦so was forced to go
into exile. After this the young patricians became more
insolent than ever, but they courted the poorest of the
people, hoping to engage them on their side against the
more respectable plebeians.</p>

<p>4. Next year all Rome was alarmed by finding that
the Capitol had been seized by an enemy during the
night. This enemy was Appius Herdonius, a Sabine,
and with him was associated a band of desperate men,
exiles and runaway slaves. The first demand he made
was that all Roman exiles should be restored. The consul,
P. Valerius, collected a force and took the Capitol,
but was killed in the assault, and Cincinnatus, father of
the banished KÃ¦so, was chosen to succeed him. When
he heard the news of his elevation, he turned to his wife,
and said: "I fear, Racilia, our little field must remain
this year unsown." Then he assumed the robe of state,
and went to Rome. It was believed that KÃ¦so had been
concerned in the desperate enterprise that had just been
defeated. What had become of him was unknown; but
that he was already dead was pretty certain; and his father
was very bitter against the tribunes and their party, to
whom he attributed his son's disgrace and death.</p>

<p>5. P. Valerius, the consul, had persuaded the plebeians
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to join in the assault of the Capitol, by promising to gain
them further privileges; this promise Cincinnatus refused
to keep, and used all his power to frustrate the attempts
of the tribunes to gain its fulfillment. At the end of his
year of office, however, when the patricians wished to
continue him in the consulship, he positively declined the
offer, and returned to his rustic life as if he had never
left it.</p>

<p>6. It was two years after these events that the deputies
of the senate, who came to invest him with the ensigns
of dictatorial power, found him working on his
little farm. He was clad in his tunic only, and as the
deputies advanced they bade him put on his toga, that he
might receive the commands of the senate in seemly
guise. So he wiped off the dust and sweat, and bade his
wife fetch his toga, and asked anxiously whether all was
right or no. Then the deputies told him how the army
was beset by the Ãquian foe, and how the Senate looked
to him as the savior of the state. A boat was provided
to carry him over the Tiber; and when he reached the
other bank, he was greeted by his family and friends,
and the greater part of the senate, who followed him to
the city, while he himself walked in state, with his four
and twenty lictors.</p>

<p>7. That same day the dictator and his master of horse
came down into the forum, ordered all shops to be shut,
and all business to be suspended. All men of the military
age were to meet in the Field of Mars before sunset,
each man with five days' provisions and twelve stakes;
the older men were to get the provisions ready, while the
soldiers were preparing the stakes. Thus all was got ready
in time: the dictator led them forth; and they marched
so rapidly, that by midnight they had reached Mount
Algidus, where the army of the consul was hemmed in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
    8. Then the dictator, when he had discovered the
place of the enemy's army, ordered his men to put all
their baggage down in one place, and then to surround
the enemy's camp. They obeyed, and each one raising
a shout, began digging the trench and fixing his stakes, so
as to form a palisade round the enemy. The consul's
army, which was hemmed in, heard the shout of their
brethren, and flew to arms; and so hotly did they fight
all night, that the Ãquians had no time to attend to the
new foe, and next morning found themselves hemmed in
on all sides by the trench and palisade, so that they were
now between two Roman armies. They were thus forced
to surrender. The dictator required them to give up
their chiefs, and made their whole army pass under the
yoke, which was formed by two spears fixed upright in
the ground, and a third bound across them at the top.</p>

<p>9. Cincinnatus returned to Rome amid the shouts and
exultation of his soldiers: they gave him a golden crown,
in token that he had saved the lives of many citizens;
and the senate decreed that he should enter the city in
triumph. So Cincinnatus accomplished the purpose for
which he had been made dictator in twenty-four hours.
One evening he marched forth to deliver the consul, and
the next evening he returned victorious. But he would
not lay down his high office till he had avenged his son.
Accordingly, he summoned Volscius Fictor, the accuser,
and had him tried for perjury. The man was condemned
and banished; and then Cincinnatus once more returned
to his wife and farm.</p>

<h2><i>XXIX.&mdash;THE ROMAN FATHER.</i></h2>

<p>1. Among the most interesting of the early legends of
Rome is that of Virginius, a soldier of the army belonging
to the plebeian order.
While performing
his duty in the army
which was encamped
about twenty miles from
Rome, his young daughter,
Virginia, about fifteen
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
years of age found her home with her near relatives
in the city. Her beauty attracted the attention of Appius
Claudius, one of the ten governors of Rome. With the
view of getting possession of her person, he ordered one
of his clients, M. Claudius by name, to lay hands upon her
as she was going to her school in the Forum, and to claim
her as his slave. The man did so; and when the cries of
her nurse brought a crowd round them, M. Claudius insisted
on taking her before the decemvir, in order (as he
said) to have the case fairly tried. Her friends consented,
and no sooner had Appius heard the matter, than he
gave judgment that the maiden should be delivered up to
the claimant, who should be bound to produce her in case
her alleged father appeared to gainsay the claim.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="p141-illus.jpg" id="p141-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p141-illus.jpg" width="500" height="671" alt="Claimed as a slave" title="" />
 <p class="caption2"><i>The Seizure of Virginia.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Now this judgment was directly against one of the
laws of the Twelve Tables, which Appius himself had
framed: for therein it was provided, that any person being
at freedom should continue free, till it was proved
that such person was a slave. Icilius her betrothed,
therefore, with Numitorius, the uncle of the maiden,
boldly argued against the legality of the judgment; and
at length, Appius, fearing a tumult, agreed to leave the
girl in their hands, on condition of their giving bail to
bring her before him next morning; and then, if Virginius
did not appear, he would at once, he said, give her
up to her pretended master.</p>

<p>3. To this Icilius consented; but he delayed giving
bail, pretending that he could not procure it readily, and
in the mean time he sent off a secret message to the camp
on Algidus to inform Virginius of what had happened.
As soon as the bail was given, Appius also sent a message
to the decemvirs in command of that army, ordering
them to refuse leave of absence to Virginius. But when
this last message arrived, Virginius was already half-way
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
on his road to Rome; for the distance was not more than
twenty miles, and he had started at nightfall.</p>

<p>4. Next morning early, Virginius entered the forum
leading his daughter by the hand, both clad in mean attire.
A great number of friends and matrons attended
him; and he went about among the people entreating
them to support him against the tyranny of Appius. So,
when Appius came to take his place on the judgment-seat,
he found the forum full of people, all friendly to
Virginius and his cause. But he inherited the boldness
as well as the vices of his sires, and though he saw Virginius
standing there, ready to prove that he was the maiden's
father, he at once gave judgment against his own
law, that Virginia should be given up to M. Claudius,
till it should be proved that she was free. The wretch
came up to seize her, and the lictors kept the people from
him. Virginius now despairing of deliverance, begged
Appius to allow him to ask the maiden whether she were
indeed his daughter or no. "If," said he, "I find I am
not her father, I shall bear her loss the lighter." Under
this pretense, he drew her aside to a spot upon the northern
side of the forum (afterward called the NovÃ¦ TabernÃ¦),
and here, snatching up a knife from a butcher's stall, he
cried: "In this way only can I keep thee free!" and,
so saying, stabbed her to the heart.</p>

<p>5. Then he turned to the tribunal, and said: "On
thee, Appius, and on thy head be this blood." Appius
cried out to sieze "the murderer"; but the crowd made
way for Virginius, and he passed through them holding
up the bloody knife, and went out at the gate, and made
straight for the army. There, when the soldiers had
heard his tale, they at once abandoned their decemviral
generals, and marched to Rome. They were soon followed
by the other army from the Sabine frontier; for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to them Icilius had gone, and Numitorius; and they
found willing ears among the men. So the two armies
joined their banners, elected new generals, and encamped
upon the Aventine hill, the quarter of the plebeians.</p>

<p>6. Meantime, the people at home had risen against Appius;
and after driving him from the forum, they joined
their armed fellow citizens upon the Aventine. There the
whole body of the commons, armed and unarmed, hung
like a dark cloud ready to burst upon the city.</p>

<h3>VIRGINIUS.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. When Appius Claudius saw that deed he shuddered and sank down,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And hid his face some little space with the corner of his gown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till with white lips and blood-shot eyes Virginius tottered nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And stood before the judgment-seat, and held the knife on high.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Oh! dwellers in the nether gloom, avengers of the slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By this dear blood, I cry to you, do right between us twain;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And even as Appius Claudius hath dealt with me and mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Deal you by Appius Claudius and all the Claudian line!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So spake the slayer of his child, and turned, and went his way;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But first he cast one haggard glance to where the body lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And writhed, and groaned a fearful groan; and then with steadfast feet,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
    <span class="i1">Strode right across the market-place into the sacred street.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">2. Then up sprang Appius Claudius: "Stop him; alive or dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ten thousand pounds of copper to the man who brings his head."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He looked upon his clients, but none would work his will.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He looked upon his lictors, but they trembled and stood still.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And as Virginius, through the press, his way in silence cleft,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ever the mighty multitude fell back to right and left.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And he hath passed in safety unto his woful home,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And there ta'en horse to tell the camp what deeds are done in Rome.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">3. By this the flood of people was swollen from every side,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And streets and porches round were filled with that o'erflowing tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And close around the body gathered a little train<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of them that were the nearest and dearest to the slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They brought a bier, and hung it with many a cypress crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And gently they uplifted her, and gently laid her down.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The face of Appius Claudius wore the Claudian scowl and sneer,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And in the Claudian note he cried, "What doth this rabble here?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Have they no crafts to mind at home, that hitherward they stray?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ho! lictors, clear the market-place, and fetch the corpse away!"<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">4. Till then the voice of pity and fury was not loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But a deep, sullen murmur, wandered among the crowd.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like the moaning noise that goes before the whirlwind on the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or the growl of a fierce watch-dog but half-aroused from sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But when the lictors at that word, tall yeomen all, and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Each with his axe and sheaf of twigs, went down into the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Those old men say, who saw that day of sorrow and of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That in the Roman Forum was never such a din.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The wailing, hooting, cursing, the howls of grief and hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Were heard beyond the Pincian hill, beyond the Latin gate.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">5. But close around the body, where stood the little train<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of them that were the nearest and dearest to the slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No cries were there, but teeth set fast, low whispers, and black frowns,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And breaking up of benches, and girding up of gowns.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Twas well the lictors might not pierce to where the maiden lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Else surely had they been all twelve torn limb from limb that day.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
    <span class="i1">Right glad they were to struggle back, blood streaming from their heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With axes all in splinters, and raiment all in shreds.<br /></span>

<h2><i>XXX.&mdash;ARCHIMEDES.</i></h2>

<p>1. This extraordinary man was a native of Syracuse, a
city of Sicily. He was born two hundred and eighty-eight
years before the Christian era, and from fifty to one
hundred years after the appearance of the far-famed Euclid.
Who his parents were, and what was their rank in
life are not known, though it is claimed that he was in
some way related to Hiero the king of Syracuse. It is said
that Hiero considered himself greatly honored by such a
relation, and well he might be, for science and genius combined
are much higher than royalty. Besides it is probable
that the name of the monarch would never have been
preserved except in connection with the great philosopher.</p>

<p>2. By whom he was instructed in the elements of
education, history fails to inform us, but it tells us of the
progress he made in mechanics and geometry, and for the
sake of the quiet necessary to pursue these branches he
gave up all the advantages of a political life derived from
his connection with the king. His favorite studies had
more charms for him than the glitter of events or the
plunder of conquered cities.</p>

<p>3. After studying at home until he could learn nothing
more in the city of his birth, he repaired to Alexandria
in Egypt, at that time the educational center that
had inherited the philosophy and culture of Athens.
Here he studied for some years and became acquainted
with the most distinguished scholars of his day. Among
his most intimate friends was Conon, a famous mathematician
from Samos, who often exchanged problems with
him for solution. While staying at Alexandria he began
his work of practical invention which he afterward turned
to such good account.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="p151-illus.jpg" id="p151-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p151-illus.jpg" width="500" height="784" alt="A relaxing mood" title="" />
 <p class="caption2"><i>Archimedes.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Some of his ardent admirers have maintained that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 151]<br />[Pg 152]</a></span>
Archimedes taught the Egyptians more than they taught
him; that while he imbibed philosophy and book learning,
he more than repaid the New Athens by inventions
which were of the greatest use in the ordinary work of
the home and the shop. Although we do not know exactly
what he turned his hand to, we are quite sure that
in many ways he performed feats that have scarcely been
surpassed in modern times.</p>

<p>5. After his return to his native city, Archimedes
continued his studies with unabated vigor, often neglecting
his food and the care of his person when a new problem
was to be solved or a new invention perfected. The
method of determining the relative amount of gold and
base metal in Hiero's crown occurred to him while in his
bath, and without stopping to put on his clothes, he is said
to have rushed through the streets exclaiming "<i>Eureka!</i>
Eureka!"</p>

<p>6. To prevent the ruin of his health his servants were
sometimes obliged to take him by main force to the table
and bath, and to take his daily exercise. Hiero at one
time expressed an admiration of some of his inventions
when Archimedes replied that had he a place to fix
his machines upon he could move the earth itself. His
days were passed in study and retirement until the safety
of his native city called him out to take part in its
defense.</p>

<p>7. During the wars between the Romans and Carthaginians,
the people of Sicily, and especially the Syracusans,
had for a long time remained neutral or been in alliance
with the Romans. But a Carthaginian interest
sprung up which mastered and sought to extend itself
over the whole island. As soon as the news of this political
movement and rebellion reached Marcellus, the
Roman general, he hastened with a strong force into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Sicily, and after the capture of the principalities he laid
siege to Syracuse.</p>

<p>8. Here he met with an unexpected check. The inventive
genius of Archimedes enabled the Syracusans to
successfully defend their city for three years. He so improved
the warlike instruments for the discharge of missiles,
that he repeatedly beat back the most determined
assault, and the Romans were more than once on the
point of abandoning the siege, believing that the city was
defended by the gods. By means of long and powerful
levers, together with grappling irons, he is said to have destroyed
many of the Roman galleys when they approached
the walls of the city; and when they retired for
safety he set them on fire by a combination of immense
burning-glasses.</p>

<p>9. The story of these exploits is told by the Romans
themselves, and there can be no doubt but here Science
gained one of her greatest triumphs. The success of the
new engine was evidently so great, that an element of
superstition entered into the record. But the triumph of
genius was not complete. During a festival in honor of
Diana when wine flowed freely, the guards neglected to
man some particular part of the walls. The Romans observing
this scaled the walls and made themselves masters
of the city.</p>

<p>10. Amid the plunder and carnage which followed,
Archimedes was killed. Marcellus had given orders for
his special protection, but the deed was done by a Roman
soldier. One account says that he was slain in his laboratory
where he was found studying a problem, and he refused
to move until he had completed the solution. Another
account says that he was put to death on the street
while drawing a geometrical figure in the sand. The
third and most rational account is that while bearing some
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
boxes of mathematical instruments to Marcellus he was
killed by a soldier who supposed that the boxes contained
treasure. His death happened about 210 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> at the age
of seventy-six.</p>

<h2><i>XXXI.&mdash;THE DEATH OF CÃSAR.</i></h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 140px;">
    <a name="p154-illus.jpg" id="p154-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p154-illus.jpg" width="140" height="212" alt="His image" title="" />
 <p class="caption2"><i>CÃ¦sar (enlarged from a Roman Coin).</i></p>
</div>
<p>1. The greatest of Rome's generals, and one of the
greatest of military chieftains of all ages, was Julius
CÃ¦sar. Of a patrician
family, he was one of the
most accomplished men
of Rome. He was great
in civil as well as military
life. He became
the most popular of the
greatest men of Rome's
most brilliant days. His
military feats rivaled
those of Alexander, and
he extended the rule of
Rome through all central
Europe, completely
subduing all of the tribes
with which he came in
contact. From his northern
victories he turned
his victorious army south,
crossed the Rubicon,
which marked the border of his own province, and seized
the control of Rome.</p>

<p>2. In the management of civil affairs he was as successful
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
as in the field. He corrected abuses that had
crept into the political management of affairs, and placed
new safeguards around the rights of the people.</p>

<p>3. His administration was almost as brilliant as that
of Pericles in Athens; yet the principal nobles did not
love him, and with the people at large he suffered still
more, from a belief that he wished to be made king. On
his return from Spain he had been named dictator and
imperator for life. His head had for some time been
placed on the money of the republic, a regal honor conceded
to none before him. Quintilis, the fifth month of
the old calendar, received from him the name which it
still bears. The senate took an oath to guard the safety
of his person.</p>

<p>4. He was honored with sacrifices, and honors hitherto
reserved for the gods. But CÃ¦sar was not satisfied. He
was often heard to quote the sentiment of Euripides, that,
"if any violation of law is excusable, it is excusable for
the sake of gaining sovereign power." It was no doubt
to ascertain the popular sentiments that various propositions
were made toward an assumption of the title of
king. His statues in the forum were found crowned with
a diadem; but two of the tribunes tore it off, and the mob
applauded.</p>

<p>5. On the 26th of January, at the great Latin festival
on the Alban Mount, voices in the crowd saluted him as
king; but mutterings of discontent reached his ears, and
he promptly said; "I am no king, but CÃ¦sar." The final
attempt was made at the Lupercalia on the 15th of February.
Antony, in the character of one of the priests of
Pan, approached the dictator as he sat presiding in his
golden chair, and offered him an embroidered band, like
the diadem of Oriental sovereigns. The applause which
followed was partial, and the dictator put the offered gift
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
aside. Then a burst of genuine cheering greeted him,
which waxed louder still when he rejected it a second
time. Old traditional feeling was too strong at Rome
even for CÃ¦sar's daring temper to brave it. The people
would submit to the despotic rule of a dictator, but would
not have a king.</p>

<p>6. Other causes of discontent had been agitating various
classes at Rome. The more fiery partisans of CÃ¦sar
disapproved of his clemency; the more prodigal sort
were angry at his regulations for securing the provincials
from oppression. The populace of the city complained&mdash;the
genuine Romans, at seeing favor extended to provincials,
those of foreign origin because they had been
excluded from the corn bounty. CÃ¦sar, no doubt, was
eager to return to his army, and escape from the increasing
difficulties which beset his civil government.
But as soon as he joined the army, he would assume
monarchical power in virtue of the late decree; and this
consideration urged the discontented to a plot against his
life.</p>

<p>7. The difficulty was to find a leader. At length
Marcus Junius Brutus accepted the post of danger. This
young man, a nephew of Cato, had taken his uncle as an
example for his public life. But he was fonder of speculation
than of action. His habits were reserved, rather
those of a student than a statesman. He had reluctantly
joined the cause of Pompey, for he could ill forget that
it was by Pompey that his father had been put to death
in cold blood. After the battle of Pharsalia he was treated
by CÃ¦sar almost like a son. In the present year he
had been proclaimed prÃ¦tor of the city, with the promise
of the consulship. But the discontented remnants of
the senatorial party assailed him with constant reproaches.
The name of Brutus, dear to all Roman patriots, was made
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
a rebuke to him. "His ancestors expelled the Tarquins;
could he sit quietly under a king's rule?" At the foot
of the statue of that ancestor, or on his own prÃ¦torian
tribunal, notes were placed, containing phrases such as
these: "Thou art not Brutus: would thou wert." "Brutus,
thou sleepest." "Awake, Brutus." Gradually he was
brought to think that it was his duty as a patriot to put an
end to CÃ¦sar's rule even by taking his life.</p>

<p>8. The most notable of those who arrayed themselves
under him was Cassius. This man's motive is unknown.
He had never taken much part in politics; he had made
submission to the conquerer, and had been received with
marked favor. Some personal reason probably actuated
his unquiet spirit. More than sixty persons were in the
secret, most of them, like Brutus and Cassius, under personal
obligations to the dictator. Publius Servilius Casca
was by his grace tribune of the plebs. Lucius Tullius
Cimber was promised the government of Bithynia. Decius
Brutus, one of his old Gallic officers, was prÃ¦tor
elect, and was to be gratified with the rich province of
Cisalpine Gaul. Caius Trebonius, another trusted officer,
had received every favor which the dictator could bestow;
he had just laid down the consulship, and was on the eve
of departure for the government of Asia. Quintius Ligarius
had lately accepted a pardon from the dictator, and
rose from a sick bed to join the conspirators.</p>

<p>9. A meeting of the senate was called for the Ides of
March, at which CÃ¦sar was to be present. This was the
day appointed for the murder. The secret had oozed out.
Many persons warned CÃ¦sar that some danger was impending.
A Greek soothsayer told him of the very day.
On the morning of the Ides his wife arose so disturbed by
dreams, that she persuaded him to relinquish his purpose
of presiding in the senate, and he sent Antony in his stead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
    10. This change of purpose was reported after the
House was formed. The conspirators were in despair.
Decius Brutus at once went to CÃ¦sar, told him that the
Fathers were only waiting to confer upon him the sovereign
power which he desired, and begged him not to listen
to auguries and dreams. CÃ¦sar was persuaded to change
his purpose, and was carried forth in his litter. On his
way, a slave who had discovered the conspiracy tried to
attract his notice, but was unable to reach him for the
crowd. A Greek philosopher, named Artemidorus, succeeded
in putting a roll of paper into his hand, containing
full information of the conspiracy; but CÃ¦sar, supposing
it to be a petition, laid it by his side for a more
convenient season. Meanwhile, the conspirators had reason
to think that their plot had been discovered. A friend
came up to Casca and said, "Ah, Casca, Brutus has told
me your secret!" The conspirator started, but was relieved
by the next sentence: "Where will <i>you</i> find money
for the expenses of the Ã¦dileship?" More serious alarm
was felt when Popillius LÃ¦nas remarked to Brutus and
Cassius: "You have my good wishes; but what you do,
do quickly"&mdash;especially when the same senator stepped
up to CÃ¦sar on his entering the house, and began whispering
in his ear. So terrified was Cassius, that he thought
of stabbing himself instead of CÃ¦sar, till Brutus quietly
observed, that the gestures of Popillius indicated that he
was asking a favor, not revealing a fatal secret. CÃ¦sar
took his seat without further delay.</p>

 <p class="caption2"><i>Antony delivering the Oration on the Death of CÃ¦sar.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. As was agreed, Cimber presented a petition praying
for his brother's recall from banishment; and all the
conspirators pressed round the dictator, urging his favorable
answer. Displeased at their importunity, CÃ¦sar
attempted to rise. At that moment Cimber seized the
lappet of his robe, and pulled him down; and immediately
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 159]<br />[Pg 160]</a></span>
Casca struck him from the side, but inflicted only a
slight wound. Then all drew their daggers and assailed
him. CÃ¦sar for a time defended himself with the gown
folded over his left arm, and the sharp-pointed style which
he held in his right hand for writing on the wax of his
tablets. But when he saw Brutus among the assassins, he
exclaimed, "You, too, Brutus!" and covering his face with
his gown, offered no further resistance. In their eagerness,
some blows intended for their victim fell upon themselves.
But enough reached CÃ¦sar to do the bloody work. Pierced
by twenty-three wounds, he fell at the base of Pompey's
statue, which had been removed after Pharsalia by Antony,
but had been restored by the magnanimity of CÃ¦sar.</p>

<p>12. Thus died "the foremost man of all the world,"
a man who failed in nothing that he attempted. He
might, Cicero thought, have been a great orator; his "Commentaries"
remain to prove that he was a great writer.
As a general he had few superiors, as a statesman and
politician no equal. That which stamps him as a man of
true greatness, is the entire absence of vanity and self-conceit
from his character. He paid, indeed, great attention
to his personal appearance, even when his hard
life and unremitting activity had brought on fits of an
epileptic nature, and left him with that meager visage
which is familiar to us from his coins. Even then he was
sedulous in arranging his robes, and was pleased to have
the privilege of wearing a laurel crown to hide the scantiness
of his hair. But these were foibles too trifling to be
taken as symptoms of real vanity. His successes in war,
achieved by a man who in his forty-ninth year had hardly
seen a camp, add to our conviction of his real genius.
These successes were due not so much to scientific man&oelig;uvres,
as to rapid audacity of movement, and mastery
over the wills of men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>13. The effect of CÃ¦sar's fall was to cause a renewal
of bloodshed for another half generation; and then his
work was finished by a far less general ruler. Those who
slew CÃ¦sar were guilty of a great crime, and a still greater
blunder.</p>

<h2><i>XXXII.&mdash;HOW ROMANS LIVED.</i></h2>

<p>1. The Roman house at first was extremely simple,
being of but one room, called the <i>atrium</i> or darkened
chamber, because its walls were stained by the smoke
that rose from the fire upon the hearth, and with difficulty
found its way through a hole in the roof. The
aperture also admitted light and rain, the water that
dripped from the roof being caught in a cistern that was
formed in the middle of the room. The atrium was entered
by way of a vestibule open to the sky, in which the
gentleman of the house put on his toga as he went out.
Double doors admitted the visitor to the entrance-hall, or
<i>ostium</i>.</p>

<p>2. There was a threshold upon which it was unlucky
to place the left foot; a knocker afforded means of announcing
one's approach, and a porter, who had a small
room at the side, opened the door, showing the caller the
words <i>Cave canem</i> (beware of the dog), or <i>Salve</i> (welcome),
or perchance the dog himself reached out toward the visitor
as far as his chain would allow. Sometimes, too, there
would be noticed in the mosaic of the pavement the representation
of the faithful domestic animal which has so long
been the companion as well as the protector of his human
friend. Perhaps myrtle or laurel might be seen on a door,
indicating that a marriage was in process of celebration,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
or a chaplet announcing the happy birth of an heir. Cypress,
probably set in pots in the vestibule, indicated a
death, as a crape festoon does upon our own door-handles,
while torches, lamps, wreaths, garlands, branches of trees,
showed that there was joy from some cause in the house.</p>

<p>3. In the "black room" the bed stood; there the
meals were cooked and eaten, there the goodman received
his friends, and there the goodwife sat in the
midst of her maidens spinning. The original house grew
larger in the course of time: wings were built on the
sides&mdash;and the Romans called them wings as well as we
(<i>ala</i>, a wing). Beyond the black room a recess was built
in which the family records and archives were preserved,
but with it for a long period the Roman house stopped
its growth.</p>

<p>4. Before the empire came, however, there had been
great progress in making the dwelling convenient as well
as luxurious. Another hall had been built out from the
room of archives, leading to an open court, surrounded by
columns, known as the <i>peristylum</i> (<i>peri</i>, about, <i>stulos</i>, a
pillar), which was sometimes of great magnificence. Bedchambers
were made separate from the atrium, but they
were small, and would not seem very convenient to modern
eyes.</p>

<p>5. The dining-room, called the <i>triclinium</i> (Greek,
<i>kline</i>, a bed) from its three couches, was a very important
apartment. In it were three lounges surrounding a
table, on each of which three guests might be accommodated.
The couches were elevated above the table, and
each man lay almost flat on his breast, resting on his left
elbow, and having his right hand free to use, thus putting
the head of one near the breast of the man behind him,
and making natural the expression that he lay in the
bosom of the other. As the guests were thus arranged
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
by threes, it was natural that the rule should have been
made that a party at dinner should not be less in number
than the Graces, nor more than the Muses, though it has
remained a useful one ever since.</p>

<p>6. Before the republic came to an end, it was so fashionable
to have a book-room that ignorant persons who
might not be able to read even the titles of their own
books endeavored to give themselves the appearance of
erudition by building book-rooms in their houses, and furnishing
them with elegance. The books were in cases arranged
around the walls in convenient manner, and busts
and statues of the Muses, of Minerva, and of men of note
were used then as they are now for ornaments. House-philosophers
were often employed to open to the uninstructed
the stores of wisdom contained in the libraries.</p>

 <p class="caption2"><i>Interior of a Roman Bath-Room, Ruins of Pompeii.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. As wealth and luxury increased, the Romans added
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the bath-room to their other apartments. In the early
ages they had bathed for comfort and cleanliness once a
week, but the warm bath was apparently unknown to
them. In time this became very common, and in the
days of Cicero there were hot and cold baths, both public
and private, which were well patronized. Some were
heated by fires in flues, directly under the floors, which
produced a vapor-bath. The bath was, however, considered
a luxury, and at a later date it was held a capital
offense to indulge in one on a religious holiday, and the
public baths were closed when any misfortune happened
to the republic.</p>


<p>8. Comfort and convenience united to take the cooking
out of the atrium into a separate apartment known as
the <i>culina</i>, or kitchen, in which was a raised platform on
which coals might be burned, and the processes of broiling,
boiling, and roasting might be carried on in a primitive
manner, much like the arrangement still to be seen
at Rome. On the tops of the houses, after a while, terraces
were planned for the purpose of basking in the sun,
and sometimes they were furnished with shrubs, fruit-trees,
and even fish-ponds. Often there were upward of
fifty rooms in a house on a single floor; but in the course
of time land became so valuable that other stories were
added, and many lived in flats. A flat was sometimes
called an <i>insula</i>, which meant, properly, a house not
joined to another, and afterward was applied to hired
lodgings. <i>Domus</i>, a house, meant a dwelling occupied
by one family, whether it were an <i>insula</i> or not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

 <p class="caption2"><i>Lares and Penates.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. The floors of these rooms were sometimes, but not
often, laid with boards, and generally were formed of
stones, tiles, bricks, or some sort of cement. In the
richer dwellings they were often inlaid with mosaics of
elegant patterns. The walls were often faced with marble,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
but they were usually adorned with paintings; the
ceilings were left uncovered, the beams supporting the
floor or the roof above being visible, though it was frequently
arched over. The means of lighting either by
day or night, were defective. The atrium was, as we
have seen, lighted from above, and the same was true of
other apartments, those at the side being illuminated from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the larger ones in the middle of the house. There were
windows, however, in the upper stories, though they were
not protected by glass, but covered with shutters or lattice-work,
and, at a later period, were glazed with sheets
of mica. Smoking lamps, hanging from the ceiling or
supported by candelabra, or candles gave a gloomy light
by night in the houses, and torches without.</p>

<p>10. The sun was chiefly depended upon for heat, for
there were no proper stoves, though braziers were used to
burn coals upon, the smoke escaping through the aperture
in the ceiling, and, in rare cases, hot-air furnaces
were constructed below, the heat being conveyed to the
upper rooms through pipes. There has been a dispute regarding
chimneys, but it seems almost certain that the
Romans had none in their dwellings, and indeed, there
was little need of them for purposes of artificial warmth
in so moderate a climate as theirs.</p>

<p>11. Such were some of the chief traits of the city-houses
of the Romans. Besides these there were villas in
the country, some of which were simply farm-houses, and
others places of rest and luxury supported by the residents
of cities. The farm-villa was placed, if possible, in
a spot secluded from visitors, protected from the severest
winds, and from the malaria of marshes, in a well-watered
place, near the foot of a well-wooded mountain. It had
accommodations for the kitchen, the wine-press, the farm
superintendent, the slaves, the animals, the crops, and the
other products of the farm. There were baths, and cellars
for the wine and for the confinement of the slaves
who might have to be chained.</p>

 <p class="caption2"><i>Roman Villa.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. Varro thus describes life at a rural household: "Manius
summons his people to rise with the sun, and in person
conducts them to the scene of their daily work. The
youths make their own bed, which labor renders soft to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
them, and supply themselves with water-pot, and lamp.
Their drink is the clear fresh spring; their fare bread,
with onions as a relish. Everything prospers in house
and field. The house is no work of art, but an architect
might learn symmetry from it. Care is taken of the
field that it shall not be left disorderly, and waste or go
to ruin through slovenliness or neglect; and in return,
grateful Ceres wards off damage from the produce, that
the high-piled sheaves may gladden the heart of the husbandman.
Here hospitality still holds good, the bread-pantry,
the wine-vat, and the store of sausages on the
rafter, lock and key are at the service of the traveler, and
piles of food are set before him; contented, the sated
guest sits, looking neither before him, nor behind, dozing
by the hearth in the kitchen. The warmest double wool
sheepskin is spread as a couch for him. Here people
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
still, as good burgesses, obey the righteous law which
neither out of envy injures the innocent, nor out of favor
pardons the guilty. Here they speak no evil against their
neighbors. Here they trespass not with their feet on the
sacred hearth, but honor the gods with devotion and with
sacrifices; throw to the familiar spirit his little bit of
flesh into his appointed little dish, and when the master
of the household dies accompany the bier with the same
prayer with which those of his father and of his grandfather
were borne forth."</p>

<h2>MEDIÃVAL RECORD.</h2>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2><i>XXXIII.&mdash;CONVERSION OF THE ENGLISH.</i></h2>

<p>1. Some time before Gregory became Pope, perhaps
about the year 574, he went one day through the market
at Rome, where, among other things, there were still
men, women, and children to be sold as slaves. He saw
there some beautiful boys who had just been brought by
a slave-merchant, boys with a fair skin and long fair hair,
as English boys then would have.</p>

<p>2. He was told that they were heathen boys from the
Isle of Britain. Gregory was sorry to think that forms
which were so fair without should have no light within,
and he asked again what was the name of their nation.
"<i>Angles</i>," he was told. "<i>Angles</i>," said Gregory; "they
have the faces of <i>angels</i>, and they ought to be made
fellow-heirs of the angels in heaven. But of what
province or tribe of the Angles are they?" "Of <i>Deira</i>,"
said the merchant. "<i>De ira!</i>" said Gregory; "then
they must be delivered from the wrath of God. And
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
what is the name of their king?" "<i>Ãlla.</i>" "<i>Ãlla</i>;
then <i>Alleluia</i> shall be sung in his land."</p>

<p>3. Gregory then went to the Pope, and asked him to
send missionaries into Britain, of whom he himself would
be one, to convert the English. The Pope was willing,
but the people of Rome, among whom Gregory was a
priest and was much beloved, would not let him go. So
nothing came of the matter for some time.</p>

<p>4. We do not know whether Gregory was able to do
anything for the poor English boys whom he saw in the
market, but he certainly never forgot his plan for converting
the English people. After a while he became
Pope himself. Of course, he now no longer thought of
going into Britain himself, as he had enough to do in
Rome. But he now had power to send others. He
therefore presently sent a company of monks, with one
called Augustine at their head, who became the first
Archbishop of Canterbury, and is called the Apostle of
the English.</p>

<p>5. This was in 597. The most powerful king in
Britain at this time was Ãthelbert, of Kent, who is said
to have been lord over all the kings south of the Humber.
This Ãthelbert had done what was very seldom done by
English kings then or for a long time after; he had married
a foreign wife, the daughter of Chariberth, one of
the kings of the Franks, in Gaul.</p>

<p>6. Now, the Franks had become Christians; so when
the Frankish queen came over to Kent, Ãthelbert promised
that she should be allowed to keep to her own religion
without let or hindrance. She brought with her,
therefore, a Frankish bishop named Lindhard, and the
queen and her bishop used to worship God in a little
church near Canterbury, called Saint Martin's, which had
been built in the Roman times. So you see that both
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Ãthelbert and his people must have known something
about the Christian faith before Augustine came.</p>

<p>7. It does not, however, seem that either the king or
any of his people had at all thought of turning Christians.
This seems strange when one reads how easily they were
converted afterward. One would have thought that
Bishop Lindhard would have been more likely to convert
them than Augustine, for, being a Frank, he would speak
a tongue not very different from English, while Augustine
spoke Latin, and, if he ever knew English at all, he must
have learned it after he came into the island. I can not
tell you for certain why this was. Perhaps they did not
think that a man who had merely come in the queen's
train was so well worth listening to as one who had come
on purpose all the way from the great city of Rome, to
which all the West still looked up as the capital of the
world.</p>

<p>8. So Augustine and his companions set out from
Rome, and passed through Gaul, and came into Britain,
even as CÃ¦sar had done ages before. But this time Rome
had sent forth men not to conquer lands, but to win souls.
They landed first in the Isle of Thanet, which joins close
to the east part of Kent, and thence they sent a message
to King Ãthelbert, saying why they had come into his
land. The king sent word back to them to stay in the
isle till he had fully made up his mind how to treat them;
and he gave orders that they should be well taken care of
meanwhile.</p>

<p>9. After a little while he came himself into the isle,
and bade them come and tell him what they had to say.
He met them in the open air, for he would not meet them
in a house, as he thought they might be wizards, and that
they might use some charm or spell, which he thought
would have less power out-of-doors. So they came, carrying
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
an image of our Lord on the cross, wrought in silver,
and singing litanies as they came. And when they
came before the king, they preached the gospel to him
and to those who were with him.</p>

<p>10. So King Ãthelbert hearkened to them, and he
made answer like a good and wise man. "Your words
and promises," said he, "sound very good unto me; but
they are new and strange, and I can not believe them all
at once, nor can I leave all that I and my fathers, and the
whole English folk, have believed so long. But I see that
ye have come from a far country to tell us that which ye
yourselves hold for truth; so ye may stay in the land,
and I will give you a house to dwell in and food to eat;
and ye may preach to my folk, and if any man of them
will believe as ye believe, I hinder him not."</p>

<p>11. So he gave them a house to dwell in in the royal
city of Canterbury, and he let them preach to the people.
And, as they drew near to the city, they carried their
silver image of the Lord Jesus, and sang litanies, saying,
"We pray Thee, O Lord, let thy anger and thy wrath
be turned away from this city, and from thy holy house,
because we have sinned. Alleluia!"</p>

<p>12. Thus Augustine and his companions dwelt at Canterbury,
and worshiped in the old church where the
queen worshiped, and preached to the men of the land.
And many men hearkened to them and were baptized,
and before long King Ãthelbert himself believed and
was baptized; and before the year was out there were
added to the Church more than ten thousand souls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>XXXIV.&mdash;LEO THE SLAVE.</i></h2>

<p>1. In <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 533, the Franks had fully gained possession
of all the north of Gaul, except Brittany. Clovis
had made them Christians in name, but they still
remained horribly savage, and the life of the Gauls
under them was wretched. The Burgundians and Visigoths,
who had peopled the southern and eastern provinces,
were far from being equally violent. They had
entered on their settlements on friendly terms, and even
showed considerable respect for the Roman-Gallic senators,
magistrates, and higher clergy, who all remained
unmolested in their dignity and riches. Thus it was that
Gregory, Bishop of Langres, was a man of high rank and
consideration in the Burgundian kingdom, whence the
Christian Queen Clotilda had come; and even after the
Burgundians had been subdued by the four sons of Clovis,
he continued a rich and prosperous man.</p>

<p>2. After one of the many quarrels and reconciliations
between these fierce brethren, there was an exchange of
hostages for the observance of the terms of the treaty.
These were not taken from among the Franks, who were
too proud to submit to captivity, but from among the
Gaulish nobles, a much more convenient arrangement for
the Frankish kings, who cared for the life of a "Roman"
infinitely less than even for the life of a Frank. Thus
many young men of senatorial families were exchanged
between the domains of Theodoric to the south, and of
Hildebert to the northward, and quartered among Frankish
chiefs, with whom at first they had nothing more to
endure than the discomfort of living as guests with such
rude and coarse barbarians.</p>

<p>3. But ere long fresh quarrels arose between Theodoric
and Hildebert, and the unfortunate hostages were at once
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
turned into slaves. Some of them ran away, if they were
near the frontier; but Bishop Gregory was in the utmost
anxiety about his nephew Attalus, who had been last
heard of as being placed under the charge of a Frank
who lived between TrÃ¨ves and Metz. The bishop sent
emissaries to make secret inquiries, and they brought back
the word that the unfortunate youth had been reduced to
slavery, and was made to keep his master's herds of horses.
Upon this the uncle again sent off his messengers with
presents for the ransom of Attalus; but the Frank rejected
them, saying, "One of such high race can only be redeemed
for ten pounds weight of gold."</p>

<p>4. This was beyond the bishop's means, and, while he
was considering how to raise the sum, the slaves were all
lamenting for their young lord, to whom they were much
attached, till one of them, named Leo, the cook to the
household, came to the bishop, saying to him, "If thou
wilt give me leave to go, I will deliver him from captivity."
The bishop replied that he gave free permission,
and the slave set off for TrÃ¨ves, and there watched anxiously
for an opportunity of gaining access to Attalus;
but, though the poor young man, no longer daintily
dressed, bathed, and perfumed, but ragged and squalid,
might be seen following his herds of horses, he was too
well watched for any communication to be held with him.</p>

<p>5. Then Leo went to a person, probably of Gallic
birth, and said: "Come with me to this barbarian's house,
and there sell me for a slave. Thou shalt have the money;
I only ask thee to help me thus far." Both repaired to
the Frank's abode, the chief among a confused collection
of clay and timber huts, intended for shelter during eating
and sleeping. The Frank looked at the slave, and asked
him what he could do. "I can dress whatever is eaten
at lordly tables," replied Leo. "I am afraid of no rival;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
I only tell thee the truth when I say that, if thou wouldst
give a feast to the king, I could send it up in the neatest
manner." "Ha!" said the barbarian, "the Sun's day is
coming. I shall invite my kinsmen and friends. Cook
me such a dinner as may amaze them, and make them
say, 'We saw nothing better in the king's house.'"
"Let me have plenty of poultry, and I will do according
to my master's bidding," returned Leo.</p>

<p>6. Accordingly, he was purchased for twelve gold-pieces,
and on the Sunday, as Bishop Gregory of Tours,
who tells the story, explains, that the barbarians called the
Lord's day, he produced a banquet after the most approved
Roman fashion, much to the surprise and delight
of the Franks, who had never tasted such delicacies before,
and complimented their host upon them all the
evening. Leo gradually became a great favorite, and was
placed in authority over the other slaves, to whom he
gave out their portions of broth and meat. But from the
first he had not shown any recognition of Attalus, and had
signed to him that they must be strangers to one another.</p>

<p>7. A whole year passed away in this manner, when
one day Leo wandered, as if for pastime, into the plain
where Attalus was watching the horses, and sitting down
on the ground at some paces off, and with his back toward
his young master so that they might not be seen talking
together, he said: "This is the time for thoughts of home!
When thou hast led the horses to the stable to-night, sleep
not. Be ready at the first call!"</p>

<p>8. That day the Frank lord was entertaining a large
number of guests, among them his daughter's husband, a
jovial young man, given to jesting. On going to rest he
fancied he should be thirsty at night, and called Leo to
place a pitcher of hydromel by his bedside. As the slave
was setting it down, the Frank looked slyly from under
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
his eyelids and said in joke, "Tell me, my father-in-law's
trusty man, wilt thou not some night take one of his
horses and run away to thine own home?"</p>

<p>9. "Please God, it is what I mean to do this very
night," answered the Gaul, so undauntedly that the Frank
took it as a jest, and answered, "I shall look out, then,
that thou dost not carry off anything of mine," and then
Leo left him, both laughing.</p>

<p>10. All were soon asleep, and the cook crept out to the
stable, where Attalus usually slept among the horses. He
was broad awake now, and ready to saddle the two swiftest;
but he had no weapon, except a small lance, so Leo
boldly went back to his master's sleeping hut, and took
down his sword and shield, but not without awakening
him enough to ask who was moving. "It is I, Leo," was
the answer; "I have been to call Attalus to take out the
horses early. He sleeps as hard as a drunkard." The
Frank went to sleep again, quite satisfied, and Leo, carrying
out the weapons, soon made Attalus feel like a free
man and a noble once more.</p>

<p>11. They passed unseen out of the inclosure, mounted
their horses and rode along the great Roman road from
<a name="Treves" id="Treves"></a>TrÃ¨ves as far as the Meuse, but they found the bridge
guarded, and were obliged to wait till night, when they
cast their horses loose, and swam the river, supporting
themselves on boards that they had found on the bank.
They had as yet had no food since the supper at their
master's, and were thankful to find a plum-tree in the
wood, with fruit, to refresh them in small degree, before
they lay down for the night. The next morning they
went on in the direction of Rheims, carefully listening
whether there were any sounds behind, until, on the
broad, hard-paved causeway, they heard the trampling of
horses. Happily a bush was near, behind which they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
crept, and here the riders actually halted for a few moments
to arrange their harness. Men and horses were
both those they feared, and they trembled at hearing one
say: "Woe is me that those rogues have made off, and
have not been caught! On my salvation, if I catch them, I
will have one hung, and the other chopped into little bits!"</p>

<p>12. It was no small comfort to hear the trot of the
horses resumed, and soon dying away in the distance.
That same night, the two faint, hungry, weary travelers,
foot-sore and exhausted, came stumbling into Rheims,
looking about for some person still awake, to tell them the
way to the house of the priest Paul, a friend of Attalus's
uncle. They found it just as the church-bell was ringing
for matins, a sound that must have seemed very like home
to these members of an episcopal household. They
knocked, and in the morning twilight met the priest going
to his earliest Sunday-morning service. Leo told his
young master's name, and how they had escaped, and the
priest's first exclamation was a strange one: "My dream
is true! This very night I saw two doves, one white
and one black, who came and perched on my hand."</p>

<p>13. The good man was overjoyed, but he scrupled to
give them any food, as it was contrary to the Church's
rules for the fast to be broken before mass; but the travelers
were half-dead with hunger, and could only say,
"The good Lord pardon us, for, saving the respect due to
his day, we must eat something, since this is the fourth
day since we have touched bread or meat." The priest,
upon this, gave them some bread and wine, and after hiding
them carefully, went to church, hoping to avert suspicion.
But their master was already at Rheims, making
strict search for them, and learning that Paul the priest
was a friend of the Bishop of Langres, he went to the
church, and there questioned him closely. But the priest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
succeeded in guarding his secret, and though he incurred
much danger&mdash;as the Salic law is very severe against
concealers of runaway slaves&mdash;he kept Attalus and Leo
for two days, till the search was over, and their strength
restored, so that they could proceed to Langres. There
they were welcomed like men risen from the dead; the
bishop wept on the neck of Attalus, and was ready to receive
Leo as a slave no more, but a friend and deliverer.</p>

<p>14. A few days after, Leo was solemnly led to the
church. Every door was set open as a sign that he might
henceforth go whithersoever he would. Bishop Gregorius
took him by the hand, and, standing, before the archdeacon,
declared that for the sake of the good services
rendered by his slave Leo, he set him free, and created
him a Roman citizen. Then the archbishop read a writing
of manumission. "Whatever is done according to the
Roman law is irrevocable. According to the constitution
of the Emperor Constantine, of happy memory, and the
edict that declares that whosoever is manumitted in
church, in the presence of the bishops, priests, and deacons,
shall become a Roman citizen under protection of
the Church; from this day Leo becomes a member of the
city, free to go and come where he will, as if he had
been born of free parents. From this day forward he is
exempt from all subjection of servitude, of all duty of a
freedman, all bond of clientship. He is and shall be
free, with full and entire freedom, and shall never cease
to belong to the body of Roman citizens."</p>

<p>15. At the same time Leo was endowed with lands,
which raised him to the rank of what the Franks called
a Roman proprietor, the highest reward in the bishop's
power, for the faithful devotion that had incurred such
dangers in order to rescue the young Attalus from his
miserable bondage.</p>

<h2><i>XXXV.&mdash;THE MOORS IN SPAIN.</i></h2>

<p>1. Scarcely had the Arabs become firmly settled in
Spain before they commenced a brilliant career. Adopting
what had now become the established policy of the
commanders of the Faithful in Asia, the caliphs of Cordova
distinguished themselves as patrons of learning, and
set an example of refinement strongly contrasting with
the condition of the native European princes. Cordova,
under their administration, at its highest point of prosperity,
boasted of more than two hundred thousand houses,
and more than a million inhabitants. After sunset a
man might walk through it in a straight line for ten miles
by the light of the public lamps. Seven hundred years
after this time there was not so much as one public lamp
in London. Its streets were solidly paved. In Paris,
centuries subsequently, who ever stepped over his threshold
on a rainy day stepped up to his ankles in mud.</p>

<p>2. Other cities, as Granada, Seville, Toledo, considered
themselves rivals of Cordova. The palaces of the caliphs
were magnificently decorated. Those sovereigns might
well look down with supercilious contempt on the dwellings
of the rulers of Germany, France, and England,
which were scarcely better than stables&mdash;chimneyless,
windowless, and with a hole in the roof for the smoke to
escape, like the wigwams of certain Indians.</p>

<p>3. The Spanish Mohammedans had brought with
them all the luxuries and prodigalities of Asia. Their
residences stood forth against the clear blue sky, or were
embosomed in woods. They had polished marble balconies,
overhanging orange-gardens, courts with cascades of
water, shady retreats provocative of slumber in the heat
of the day, retiring-rooms, vaulted with stained glass,
speckled with gold, over which streams of water were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
made to gush; the floors and walls were of exquisite
mosaic. Here a fountain of quicksilver shot up in a glistening
spray, the glittering particles falling with a tranquil
sound like fairy bells; there, apartments into which cool
air was drawn from flower-gardens, in summer, by means
of ventilating towers, and in the winter through earthen
pipes, or caleducts, imbedded in the walls&mdash;the hypocaust,
in the vaults below, breathing forth volumes of warm and
perfumed air through these hidden passages.</p>

<p>4. The walls were not covered with wainscot, but
adorned with arabesques and paintings of agricultural
scenes and views of paradise. From the ceilings, corniced
with fretted gold, great chandeliers hung, one of
which, it is said, was so large that it contained one thousand
and eighty-four lamps. Clusters of frail marble columns
surprised the beholder with the vast weights they
bore. In the boudoirs of the sultanas they were sometimes
of verd-antique, and incrusted with lapis-lazuli.
The furniture was of sandal and citron wood inlaid with
mother-of-pearl, ivory, silver, or relieved with gold and
precious malachite. In orderly confusion were arranged
vases of rock-crystal, Chinese porcelain, and tables of exquisite
mosaic. The winter apartments were hung with
rich tapestry; the floors were covered with embroidered
Persian carpets. Pillows and couches of elegant forms
were scattered about the rooms, which were perfumed
with frankincense.</p>

<p>5. It was the intention of the Saracen architect, by
excluding the view of the external landscape, to concentrate
attention on his work, and since the representation
of the human form was religiously forbidden, and that
source of decoration denied, his imagination ran riot with
the complicated arabesques he introduced, and sought
every opportunity of replacing the prohibited work of art
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
by the trophies and rarities of the garden. For this reason
the Arabs never produced artists; religion turned
them from the beautiful, and made them soldiers, philosophers,
and men of affairs. Splendid flowers and rare
exotics ornamented the court-yards and even the inner
chambers.</p>

<p>6. Great care was taken to make due provision for the
cleanliness, occupation, and amusement of the inmates.
Through pipes of metal, water, both warm and cold, to
suit the season of the year, ran into baths of marble; in
niches, where the current of air could be artificially
directed, hung dripping <i>alcarazzas</i>. There were whispering-galleries
for the amusement of the women; labyrinths
and marble play-courts for the children; for the master
himself, grand libraries. The Caliph Alhakem's was so
large that the catalogue alone filled forty volumes. He
had also apartments for the transcribing, binding, and
ornamenting of books. A taste for caligraphy and the
possession of splendidly illuminated manuscripts seems to
have anticipated in the caliphs, both of Asia and Spain,
the taste for statuary and painting among the later popes
of Rome.</p>

<p>7. Such were the palace and gardens of Zehra, in which
Abderrahman III honored his favorite sultana. The edifice
had twelve hundred columns of Greek, Italian, Spanish,
and African marble. The body-guard of the sovereign
was composed of twelve thousand horsemen, whose
cimeters and belts were studded with gold. This was
that Abderrahman who, after a glorious reign of fifty
years, sat down to count the number of days of unalloyed
happiness he had experienced, and could only enumerate
fourteen. "O man!" exclaimed the plaintive caliph,
"put not your trust in this present world."</p>

<p>8. No nation has ever excelled the Spanish Arabs in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the beauty and costliness of their pleasure-gardens. To
them also we owe the introduction of very many of our
most valuable cultivated fruits, such as the peach. Retaining
the love of their ancestors for the cooling effect
of water in a hot climate, they spared no pains in the
superfluity of fountains, hydraulic works, and artificial
lakes in which fish were raised for the table. Into such
a lake, attached to the palace of Cordova, many loaves
were cast each day to feed the fish.</p>

<p>9. There were also menageries of foreign animals,
aviaries of rare birds, manufactories in which skilled workmen,
obtained from foreign countries, displayed their art
in textures of silk, cotton, linen, and all the miracles of
the loom; in jewelry and filigree-work, with which they
ministered to the female pride. Under the shade of cypresses
cascades disappeared; among flowering shrubs
there were winding walks, bowers of roses, seats cut
out of rock, and crypt-like grottoes hewn in the living
stone. Nowhere was ornamental gardening better understood;
for not only did the artist try to please the eye as
it wandered over the pleasant gradation of vegetable
color and form&mdash;he also boasted his success in the gratification
of the sense of smell by the studied succession of
perfumes from beds of flowers.</p>

<p>10. In the midst of all this luxury, which can not be
regarded by the historian with disdain, since in the end it
produced a most important result in the south of France,
the Spanish caliphs, emulating the example of their Asiatic
compeers, were not only the patrons but the personal cultivators
of human learning. One of them was himself
the author of a work on polite literature in not less than
fifty volumes; another wrote a treatise on algebra. When
Taryak, the musician, came from the East to Spain, the
Caliph Abderrahman rode forth to meet him with honor.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
The College of Music in Cordova was sustained by ample
government patronage, and is said to have produced many
illustrious professors.</p>

<h2><i>XXXVI.&mdash;CHARLEMAGNE.</i></h2>

<p>1. We come now to one of the greatest men of all
times, Charles the Great, son of Pepin the Short, a man
who has left his mark on history for all time. Charles
(called by the French Charlemagne) was great in many
ways, whereas most great men are great in one or two.
He was a great warrior, a great political genius, an energetic
legislator, a lover of learning, and a lover also of his
natural language and poetry at a time when it was the
fashion to despise them. And he united and displayed
all these merits in a time of general and monotonous barbarism,
when, save in the church, the minds of men were
dull and barren.</p>

<p>2. From 769 to 813, in Germany and Western and
Northern Europe, Charlemagne conducted thirty-two
campaigns against the Saxons, Frisians, Bavarians, Avars,
Slavs, and Danes; in Italy, five against the Lombards; in
Spain, Corsica, and Sardinia, twelve against the Arabs,
two against the Greeks, and three in Gaul itself, against
the Aquitanians and Bretons&mdash;in all, fifty-three expeditions
in forty-five years, among which those he undertook
against the Saxons, the Lombards, and the Arabs were
long and difficult wars.</p>

<p>3. The kingdom of Charles was vast; it comprised
nearly all Germany, Belgium, France, Switzerland, and
the north of Italy and of Spain. He had, in ruling this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
mighty realm, to deal with different nations, without cohesion,
and to grapple with their various institutions and
bring them into system.</p>

<p>4. The first great undertaking of Charles was against
the Saxons. They were still heathen, and were a constant
source of annoyance to the Franks, for they made frequent
inroads to pillage and destroy their towns and harvests.</p>

<p>5. In the line of mountains which forms the step
from lower into upper Germany, above the Westphalian
plains, is one point at which the river Weser breaks
through and flows down into the level land about three
miles above the town of Minden. This rent in the mountain
is called the Westphalian Gate. The hills stand on
each side like red sandstone door-posts, and one is crowned
by some crumbling fragments of a castle; it is called the
Wittekindsberg, and takes its name from Wittekind, a
Saxon king, who had his castle there. Wittekind was a
stubborn heathen, and a very determined man.</p>

<p>6. In 772 Charles convoked a great assembly at
Worms, at which it was unanimously resolved to march
against the Saxons and chastise them for their incursions.
Charles advanced along the Weser, through the gate, destroyed
Wittekind's castle, pushed on to Paderborn, where
he threw down an idol adored by the Saxons, and then
was obliged to return and hurry to Italy to fight the Lombards,
who had revolted. Next year he invaded Saxony
again. He built himself a palace at Paderborn, and summoned
the Saxon chiefs to come and do homage. Wittekind
alone refused, and fled to Denmark.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="p185-illus.jpg" id="p185-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p185-illus.jpg" width="500" height="811" alt="Forced Christianity" title="" />
 <p class="caption2"><i>Charlemagne.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. No sooner had Charles gone to fight the Moors in
Spain than Wittekind returned, and the Saxons rose at
his summons, and, bursting into Franconia, devastated the
land up to the walls of Cologne. Charles returned and
fought them in two great battles, defeated them, erected
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 185]<br />[Pg 186]</a></span>
fortresses in their midst, and carried off hostages. Affairs
seemed to prosper, and Charles deemed himself as securely
master of Saxony as Varus had formerly in the same
country, and under precisely the same circumstances.
Charles then quitted the country, leaving orders for a
body of Saxons to join his Franks and march together
against the Slavs. The Saxons obeyed the call with alacrity,
and soon outnumbered the Franks. One day, as the
army was crossing the mountains from the Weser, at a
given signal the Saxons fell on their companions and
butchered them.</p>

<p>8. When the news of this disaster reached Charles he
resolved to teach the Saxons a terrible lesson. Crossing
the Rhine, he laid waste their country with fire and sword,
and forced the Saxons to submit to be baptized and accept
Christian teachers. Those who refused he killed.
At Verdun he had over four thousand of the rebels
beheaded. At Detmold, Wittekind led the Saxons
in a furious battle, in which neither gained the victory.
In another battle, on the Hase, they were completely
routed.</p>

<p>9. Then Wittekind submitted, came into the camp of
Charles, and asked to be baptized. A little ruined chapel
stands on the Wittekindsberg, above the Westphalian
Gate, and there, according to tradition, near the overturned
walls of his own castle, the stubborn heathen
bowed the neck to receive the yoke of Christ. Charles's
two nephews, the sons of Karlomann, were with Desiderius,
the Lombard king, and Desiderius tried to force the
Pope to anoint them kings of the Franks, to head a revolt
against Charles. When the great king heard this he
came over the Alps into Italy, dethroned Desiderius, and
shut him up in a monastery. Then he crowned himself
with the iron crown of the Lombard kings, which was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
said to have been made out of one of the nails that
fastened Christ to the cross.</p>

<p>10. Duke Thassils of Bavaria had married a daughter
of Desiderius, and he refused to acknowledge the authority
of Charles. He also stirred up the Avars who lived
in Hungary to invade the Frankish realm. Charles
marched against Thassils, drove him out of Bavaria, subdued
the Avars, and converted the country between the
Ems and Raab&mdash;that is, Austria proper&mdash;into a province,
which was called the East March, and formed the beginning
of the East Realm (Oesterreich), or Austria. Charles
also fought the Danes, and took from them the country
up to the river Eider.</p>

<p>11. When we consider what continuous fighting
Charles had, it is a wonder to us that he had time to govern
and make laws; but he devoted as much thought to
arranging his realm and placing it under proper governors
as he did to extending its frontiers.</p>

<p>12. Charles constituted the various parts of his vast
empire&mdash;kingdoms, duchies, and counties. He was himself
the sovereign of all these united, but he managed
them through counts and vice-counts. The frontier districts
were called marches, and were under march-counts,
or margraves. Count is not a German title; the German
equivalent is Graf, and the English is earl. The counties
were divided into hundreds; a hundred villages went to
a vice-count. He had also counts of the palace, who ruled
over the crown estates, and send-counts (<i>missi</i>), whom he
sent out yearly through the country to see that his other
counts did justice, and did not oppress the people. If
people felt themselves wronged by the counts, they appealed
to these send-counts; and if the send-counts did not
do them justice, they appealed to the palatine-counts.</p>

<p>13. Every year Charles summoned his counts four
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
times, when he could, but always once, in May, to meet
him in council, and discuss the grievances of the people.
As the great dukes were troublesome, because so powerful,
Charles tried to do without them, and to keep them
in check. He gave whole principalities to bishops, hoping
that they would become supporters of him and the
crown against the powerful dukes.</p>

<p>14. He was also very careful for the good government
of the Church. He endowed a number of monasteries to
serve as schools for boys and girls. He had also a collection
of good, wholesome sermons made in German, and
sent copies about in all directions, requiring them to be
read to the people in church. He invited singers and
musicians from Italy to come and improve the performance
of divine worship, and two song-schools were established,
one at Gall, another at Metz. His Franks, he complained,
had not much aptitude for music; their singing
was like the howling of wild beasts or the noise made by
the squeaking, groaning wheels of a baggage-wagon over
a stony road!</p>

<p>15. Charles was particularly interested in schools, and
delighted in going into them and listening to the boys at
their lessons. One day when he had paid such a visit he
was told that the noblemen's sons were much idler than
those of the common citizens. Then the great king grew
red in the face and frowned, and his eyes flashed. He
called the young nobles before him and said in thundering
tones: "You grand gentlemen! You young puppets!
You puff yourselves up with the thoughts of your rank
and wealth, and suppose you have no need of letters! I
tell you that your pretty faces and your high nobility are
accounted nothing by me. Beware! beware! Without
diligence and conscientiousness not one of you gets anything
from me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
    16. Charles dearly loved the grand old German poems
of the heroes, and he had them collected and copied out.
Alas! they have been lost. His stupid son, thinking them
rubbish, burned them all. The great king also sent to
Italy for builders, and set them to work to erect palaces
and churches. His favorite palaces were at Aix and at
Ingelheim. At the latter place he had a bridge built over
the Rhine. At Aix he built the cathedral with pillars
taken from Roman ruins. It was quite circular, with a
colonnade going round it; inside it remains almost unaltered
to the present day.</p>

<p>17. He was very eager to promote trade, and so far in
advance of the times was he that he resolved to cut a
canal so as to connect the Main with the Regnitz, and
thus make a water-way right across Germany from the
Rhine to the Danube, and so connect the German Ocean
with the Black Sea. The canal was begun, but wars interfered
with its completion, and the work was not carried
out till the present century by Louis I of Bavaria.</p>

<p>18. Charles was a tall, grand looking man, nearly seven
feet high. He was so strong that he could take a horseshoe
in his hands and snap it. He ate and drank in
moderation, and was grave and dignified in his conduct.</p>

<p>19. In the year 800, an insurrection broke out in Rome
against Pope Leo III. While he was riding in procession
his enemies fell on him, threw him from his horse, and an
awkward attempt was made to put out his eyes and cut
out his tongue. Thus, bleeding and insensible, he was
put into a monastery. The Duke of Spoleto, a Frank,
hearing of this, marched to Rome and removed the
wounded Pope to Spoleto, where he was well nursed and
recovered his eye-sight and power of speech. Charles was
very indignant when he heard of the outrage, and he left
the Saxons, whom he was fighting, and came to Italy to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
investigate the circumstance. He assumed the office of
judge, and the guilty persons were sent to prison in
France.</p>

<p>20. Then came Christmas-day, the Christmas of the
last year in the eighth century of Christ. Charles and all
his sumptuous court, the nobles and people of Rome, the
whole clergy of Rome, were present at the high services
of the birth of Christ. The Pope himself chanted the
mass; the full assembly were rapt in profound devotion.
At the close the Pope rose, advanced toward Charles with
a splendid crown in his hands, placed it upon his brow,
and proclaimed him CÃ¦sar Augustus. "God grant life
and victory to the great emperor!" His words were lost
in the acclamations of the soldiery, the people, and the
clergy.</p>

<p>21. Charles was taken completely by surprise. What
the consequences would be to Germany and to the papacy,
how fatal to both, neither he nor Leo could see. So
Charlemagne became King of Italy and Emperor of the
West&mdash;the successor of the CÃ¦sars of Rome.</p>

<p>22. When Charles felt that his end was approaching,
he summoned all his nobles to Aix into the church he had
there erected. There, on the altar, lay a golden crown.
Charles made his son Ludwig, or Louis, stand before him,
and, in the audience of his great men, gave him his last
exhortation: to fear God and to love his people as his
own children, to do right and to execute justice, and to
walk in integrity before God and man. With streaming
eyes Louis promised to fulfill his father's command.
"Then," said Charles, "take this crown, and place it on
your own head, and never forget the promise you have
made this day."</p>

<h2>WESTERN RECORD.</h2>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2><i>XXXVII.-THE NORSEMEN.</i></h2>

<p>1. The Gulf Stream flows so near to the southern coast
of Norway, and to the Orkneys and Western Islands, that
their climate is much less severe than might be supposed.
Yet no one can help wondering why they were formerly
so much more populous than now, and why the people
who came westward even so long ago as the great Aryan
migration, did not persist in turning aside to the more
fertile countries that lay farther southward. In spite of
all their disadvantages, the Scandinavian peninsula, and
the sterile islands of the northern seas, were inhabitated
by men and women whose enterprise and intelligence
ranked them above their neighbors.</p>

<p>2. Now, with the modern ease of travel and transportation,
these poorer countries can be supplied from other
parts of the world. And though the summers of Norway
are misty and dark and short, and it is difficult to
raise even a little hay on the bits of meadow among the
rocky mountain-slopes, commerce can make up for all deficiencies.
In early times there was no commerce, except
that carried on by the pirates, if we may dignify their
undertakings by such a respectable name, and it was hardly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
possible to make a living from the soil alone. But it
does not take us long to discover that the ancient Northmen
were not farmers, but hunters and fishermen. It
had grown more and more difficult to find food along the
rivers and broad grassy wastes of inland Europe, and
pushing westward they had at last reached the place where
they could live beside waters that swarmed with fish and
among hills that sheltered plenty of game.</p>

<p>3. The tribes that settled in the north grew in time
to have many peculiarities of their own, and as their
countries grew more and more populous, they needed
more things that could not easily be had, and a fashion
of plundering their neighbors began to prevail. Men
were still more or less beasts of prey. Invaders must be
kept out, and at last much of the industry of Scandinavia
was connected with the carrying on of an almost universal
fighting and marauding. Ships must be built, and
there must be endless supplies of armor and weapons.
Stones were easily collected for missiles or made fit for
arrows and spear-heads, and metals were worked with
great care.</p>

<p>4. In Norway and Sweden were the best places to
find all these, and if the Northmen planned to fight a
great battle, they had to transport a huge quantity of
stones, iron, and bronze. It is easy to see why one day's
battle was almost always decisive in ancient times, for
supplies could not be quickly forwarded from point to
point, and after the arrows were all shot and the conquered
were chased off the field, they had no further
means of offense except a hand-to-hand fight with those
who had won the right to pick up the fallen spears at
their leisure. So, too, an unexpected invasion was likely
to prove successful; it was a work of time to get ready
for a battle, and when the Northmen swooped down upon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
some shore town of Britain or Gaul, the unlucky citizens
were at their mercy. And while the Northmen had fish
and game, and were mighty hunters, and their rocks and
mines helped forward their warlike enterprises, so the
forests supplied them with ship-timber, and they gained
renown as sailors wherever their fame extended.</p>

<p>5. There was a great difference, however, between the
manner of life in Norway and that of England and
France. The Norwegian stone, however useful for arrow-heads
or axes, was not fit for building purposes.
There is hardly any clay there, either, to make bricks
with, so that wood has usually been the only material for
houses. In the southern countries there had always been
rude castles in which the people could shelter themselves,
but the Northmen could build no castles that a torch
could not destroy. They trusted much more to their
ships than to their houses, and some of their captains disdained
to live on shore at all.</p>

<p>6. There is something refreshing in the stories of old
Norse life; of its simplicity and freedom and childish
zest. An old writer says that they had "a hankering
after pomp and pageantry," and by means of this they
came at last to doing things decently and in order, and to
setting the fashions for the rest of Europe. There was
considerable dignity in the manner of every-day life and
housekeeping. Their houses were often very large, even
two hundred feet long, with flaring fires on a pavement
in the middle of the floor, and the beds built next the
walls on three sides, sometimes hidden by wide tapestries
or foreign cloth that had been brought home in the viking
ships. In front of the beds were benches where each
man had his seat and footstool, with his armor and weapons
hung high on the wall above.</p>

<p>7. The master of the house had a high seat on the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
north side in the middle of a long bench; opposite was
another bench for guests and strangers, while the women
sat on the third side. The roof was high; there were a
few windows in it, and those were covered by skins, and
let in but little light. The smoke escaped through openings
in the carved, soot-blackened roof; and though in
later times the rich men's houses were more like villages,
because they made groups of smaller buildings for store
houses, for guest-rooms, or for work-shops all around
still, the idea of this primitive great hall or living-room
has not even yet been lost. The latest copies of it in
England and France that still remain are most interesting;
but what a fine sight it must have been at night
when the great fires blazed and the warriors sat on their
benches in solemn order, and the skalds recited their long
sagas, of the host's own bravery or the valiant deeds of
his ancestors! Hospitality was almost chief among the
virtues.</p>

<p>8. We must read what was written in their own language,
and then we shall have more respect for the vikings
and sea-kings, always distinguishing between these two;
for, while any peasant who wished could be a viking&mdash;a
sea-robber&mdash;a sea-king was a king indeed, and must be
connected with the royal race of the country. He received
the title of king by right as soon as he took command
of a ship's crew, though he need not have any land
or kingdom. Vikings were merely pirates; they might
be peasants and vikings by turn, and won their names
from the inlets, the viks or wicks, where they harbored
their ships. A sea-king must be a viking, but naturally
very few of the vikings were sea-kings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="p195-illus.jpg" id="p195-illus.jpg"></a>

 <p class="caption2"><i>A Viking's Home.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. The viking had rights in his own country, and
knew what it was to enjoy those rights; if he could win
more land, he would know how to govern it, and he knew
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 195]<br />[Pg 196]</a></span>
what he was fighting for, and meant to win. If we wonder
why all this energy was spent on the high seas and
in strange countries, there are two answers: first, that
fighting was the natural employment of the men, and
that no right could be held that could not be defended;
but besides this, one form of their energy was showing
itself at home in rude attempts at literature.</p>

<p>10. The more that we know of the Northmen, the
more we are convinced how superior they were in their
knowledge of the useful arts to the people whom they
conquered. There is a legend that, when Charlemagne,
in the ninth century, saw some pirate ships cruising in the
Mediterranean, along the shores of which they had at last
found their way, he covered his face and burst into tears.
He was not so much afraid of their cruelty and barbarity
as of their civilization. Nobody knew better that none
of the Christian countries under his rule had ships or
men that could make such a daring voyage. He knew
that they were skillful workers in wood and iron, and
had learned to be rope-makers and weavers; that they
could make casks for their supply of drinking-water, and
understood how to prepare food for their long cruises.
All their swords and spears and bow-strings had to be
made and kept in good condition, and sheltered from the
sea-spray.</p>

<p>11. When we picture the famous sea-kings' ships to
ourselves, we do not wonder that the Northmen were so
proud of them, or that the skalds were never tired of recounting
their glories. There were two kinds of vessels:
the last-ships, that carried cargoes, and the long-ships, or
ships of war. Listen to the splendors of the "Long Serpent,"
which was the largest ship ever built in Norway.
A dragon-ship, to begin with, because all the long-ships
had a dragon for a figure-head, except the smallest of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
them, which were called cutters, and only carried ten
or twenty rowers on a side. The "Long Serpent" had
thirty-four rowers' benches on a side, and she was one
hundred and eleven feet long. Over the sides were hung
the shining red and white shields of the vikings, the gilded
dragon's head towered high at the prow, and at the
stern a gilded tail went curling off over the head of the
steersman. Then, from the long body, the heavy oars
swept forward and back through the water, and as it
came down the fiÃ´rd, the "Long Serpent" must have
looked like some enormous centipede creeping out of its
den on an awful errand, and heading out across the rough
water toward its prey.</p>

<p>12. The voyages were often disastrous in spite of
much clever seamanship. They knew nothing of the
mariner's compass, and found their way chiefly by the
aid of the stars&mdash;inconstant pilots enough on such foggy,
stormy seas. They carried birds, too, oftenest ravens,
and used to let them loose and follow them toward the
nearest land. The black raven was the vikings' favorite
symbol for their flags, and familiar enough it became in
other harbors than their own. They were bold, hardy
fellows, and held fast to a rude code of honor and rank
of knighthood.</p>

<p>13. The valleys of the Elbe and the Rhine, of the
Seine and the Loire, made a famous hunting-ground for
the dragon-ships to seek.</p>

<p>14. The people who lived in France were of another
sort, but they often knew how to defend themselves as
well as the Northmen knew how to attack. There are
few early French records for us to read, for the literature
of that early day was almost wholly destroyed in the religious
houses and public buildings of France. Here and
there a few pages of a poem or of a biography or chronicle
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
have been kept, but from this very fact we can understand
the miserable condition of the country.</p>

<p>15. The whole second half of the ninth century is
taken up with the histories of these invasions. We must
follow for a while the progress of events in Gaul, or
France as we call it now, though it was made up then of
a number of smaller kingdoms. The result of the great
siege of Paris was only a settling of affairs with the
Northmen for the time being; one part of the country
was delivered from them at the expense of another.</p>

<p>16. They could be bought off and bribed for a time,
but there was never to be any such thing as their going
back to their own country and letting France alone for
good and all. But as they gained at length whole tracts
of country, instead of the little wealth of a few men to
take away in their ships as at first, they began to settle
down in their new lands and to become conquerors and
colonists instead of mere plunderers. Instead of continually
ravaging and attacking the kingdoms, they slowly
became the owners and occupiers of the conquered territory;
they pushed their way from point to point.</p>

<p>17. At first, as you have seen already they trusted to
their ships, and always left their wives and children at
home in the north countries, but as time went on, they
brought their families with them and made new homes,
for which they would have to fight many a battle yet.
It would be no wonder if the women had become possessed
by a love of adventure, too, and had insisted upon
seeing the lands from which the rich booty was brought
to them, and that they had been saying for a long time:
"Show us the places where the grapes grow and the fruit-trees
bloom, where men build great houses and live in
them splendidly. We are tired of seeing only the long
larchen beams of their high roofs, and the purple and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
red and gold cloths, and the red wine and yellow wheat that
you bring away. Why should we not go to live in that
country, instead of your breaking it to pieces, and going
there so many of you, every year, only to be slain as its
enemies? We are tired of our sterile Norway and our
great Danish deserts of sand, of our cold winds and wet
weather, and our long winters that pass by so slowly while
the fleets are gone. We would rather see Seville and
Paris themselves, than only their gold and merchandise
and the rafters of their churches that you bring home for
ship timbers."</p>

<p>18. The kingdoms of France had been divided and
subdivided, and, while we find a great many fine examples
of resistance, and some great victories over the
Northmen, they were not pushed out and checked altogether.
Instead, they gradually changed into Frenchmen
themselves, different from other Frenchmen only in being
more spirited, vigorous and alert. They inspired every
new growth of the religion, language, or manners, with
their own splendid vitality. They were like plants that
have grown in dry, thin soil, transplanted to a richer spot
of ground, and sending out fresh shoots in the doubled
moisture and sunshine. And presently we shall find the
Northman becoming the Norman of history. As the
Northman, almost the first thing we admire about him is
his character, his glorious energy; as the Norman, we see
that energy turned into better channels, and bringing a
new element into the progress of civilization.</p>

<h2><i>XXXVIII.&mdash;ROLF THE GANGER.</i></h2>

<p>1. The ninth century was a sad time for both England
and France. The Gothic tribes, in their march to
the west had reached the sea in Denmark and Norway,
and had increased to such an extent as to take up all the
land fit for cultivation. The strength and courage which
they had shown in many a battle-field on the land was
now transferred to the sea, soldiers and knights becoming
vikings and pirates. Fierce worshipers were they of
the old gods Odin, Frey, and Thor. They plundered, they
burned, they slew; they especially devastated churches and
monasteries, and no coast was safe from them from the
Adriatic to the farthest north&mdash;even Rome saw their long-ships,
and, "From the fury of the Northmen, good Lord
deliver us!" was the prayer in every litany of the West.</p>

<p>2. England had been well-nigh undone by them, when
the spirit of her greatest king awoke, and by Alfred they
were overcome. Some were permitted to settle down, and
were taught Christianity and civilization, and the fresh
invaders were driven from the coast. Alfred's gallant
son and grandson held the same course, guarded their
coasts, and made their faith and themselves respected
throughout the North. But in France, the much harassed
house of Charles the Great, and the ill-compacted bond of
different nations, were little able to oppose their fierce
assaults, and ravage and devastation reigned from one end
of the country to another.</p>

<p>3. However, the vikings, on returning to their native
homes sometimes found their place filled up, and the family
inheritance incapable of supporting so many. Thus
they began to think of winning not merely gold and cattle,
but lands and houses, on the coasts they pillaged. In
Scotland, the Hebrides, and Ireland, they settled by leave
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of nothing but their swords; in England, by treaty with
Alfred; and in France, half by conquest, half by treaty,
always, however, accepting Christianity as a needful obligation
when they took posession of southern lands. Probably
they thought Thor was only the god of the north,
and that the "White Christ," as they called Him who
was made known to them in these new countries was to
be adored in what they deemed alone his territories.</p>

<p>4. Of all the sea-robbers who sailed from their rocky
dwelling-places by the fiÃ´rds of Norway, none enjoyed
higher renown than Rolf, called the ganger, or walker,
as tradition relates, because his stature was so gigantic
that, when clad in full armor, no horse could support his
weight, and he therefore always fought on foot.</p>

<p>5. Rolf's lot had, however, fallen in what he doubtless
considered as evil days. No such burnings and plunderings
as had hitherto wasted England and enriched
Norway, fell to his share; for Alfred had made the
bravest Northman feel that his fleet and army were more
than a match for theirs. Ireland was exhausted by the
former depredations of the pirates, and, from a fertile
and flourishing country had become a scene of desolation.
Scotland and its isles were too barren to afford prey to
the spoiler.</p>

<p>6. Rolf, presuming on the favor shown to his family
while returning from an expedition on the Baltic, made
a descent on the coast of Viken, a part of Norway, and
carried off the cattle wanted by his crew. The king, who
happened at that time to be in that district, was highly
displeased, and, assembling a council, declared Rolf
the Ganger an outlaw.</p>

<p>7. The banished Rolf found a great number of companions,
who, like himself, were unwilling to submit to
the strict rule of Harald, and setting sail with them, he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
first plundered and devastated the coast of Flanders, and
afterward returned to France. In the spring of 896 the
citizens of Rouen, scarcely yet recovered from the miseries
inflicted upon them by the fierce Danish rover Hasting,
were dismayed by the sight of a fleet of long, low
vessels, with spreading sails, heads carved like that of a
serpent, and sterns finished like the tail of a reptile, such
as they well knew to be the keels of the dreaded Northmen,
the harbingers of destruction and desolation. Little
hope of succor or protection was there from King Charles
the Simple; and, indeed, had the sovereign been ever so
warlike and energetic, it would little have availed Rouen,
which might have been destroyed twice over before a
messenger could reach Laon.</p>

<p>8. In this emergency, Franco, the archbishop, proposed
to go forth to meet the Northmen and attempt to
make terms for his flock. The offer was gladly accepted
by the trembling citizens, and the good archbishop went,
bearing the keys of the town, to visit the camp which
the Northmen had begun to erect upon the bank of the
river. They offered him no violence, and he performed
his errand safely. Rolf, the rude generosity of whose
character was touched by his fearless conduct, readily
agreed to spare the lives and property of the citizens, on
condition that Rouen was surrendered to him without
resistance.</p>

<p>9. Entering the town, he there established his headquarters,
and spent a whole year in the adjacent parts of
the country, during which time the Northmen so faithfully
observed their promise, that they were regarded by
the Rouennais rather as friends than as conquerors; and
Rolf, or Rollo, as the French called him, was far more
popular among them than their real sovereign. Wherever
he met with resistance, he showed, indeed, the relentless
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
cruelty of the heathen pirate; wherever he found submission,
he was a kind master.</p>

<p>10. In the course of the following year, he advanced
along the banks of the Seine as far as its junction with
the Eure. On the opposite side of the river there were
visible a number of tents, where slept a numerous army,
which Charles had at length collected to oppose this formidable
enemy. The Northmen also set up their camp,
in expectation of a battle, and darkness had just closed in
on them when a shout was heard on the opposite side of
the river, and to their surprise a voice was heard speaking
in their own language. "Brave warriors, why come
ye hither, and what do ye seek?"</p>

<p>11. "We are Northmen, come hither to conquer
France," replied Rollo. "But who art thou who speakest
our tongue so well?" "Heard ye never of Hasting?"
was the reply. "Yes," returned Rollo, "he began well,
but ended badly." "Will ye not, then," continued the
old pirate, "submit to my lord the king? Will ye not
hold of him lands and honors?" "No," replied the
Northmen, disdainfully, "we will own no lord, we will
take no gift, but we will have what we ourselves can conquer
by force."</p>

<p>12. Here Hasting took his departure, and returning
to the French camp, strongly advised the commander not
to hazard a battle. His counsel was overruled by a young
standard-bearer, who, significantly observing, "Wolves
make not war on wolves," so offended the old sea-king,
that he quitted the army that night, and never again appeared
in France. The wisdom of his advice was the
next morning made evident, by the total defeat of the
French, and the advance of the Northmen, who in a short
space after appeared beneath the walls of Paris. Failing
in their attempt to take the city, they returned to Rouen,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
where they fortified themselves, making it the capital of
the territory they had conquered.</p>

<p>13. Fifteen years passed away, the summers of which
were spent in ravaging the dominions of Charles the Simple,
and the winters in the city of Rouen, and in the
meantime a change had come over the leader. He had
been insensibly softened and civilized by his intercourse
with the good Archbishop Franco, and finding, perhaps,
that it was not quite so easy as he had expected to conquer
the whole kingdom of France, he declared himself
willing to follow the example which he once despised, and
to become a vassal of the French crown for the duchy of
Neustria.</p>

<p>14. Charles, greatly rejoiced to find himself thus able
to put a stop to the dreadful devastations of the Northmen,
readily agreed to the terms proposed by Rollo, appointing
the village of St. Clair-sur-Epte, on the borders
of Neustria, as the place of meeting for the purpose of
receiving his homage and oath of fealty.</p>

<p>15. The greatest difficulty to be overcome in this conference
was the repugnance felt by the proud Northman
to perform the customary act of homage before any living
man, especially one whom he held so cheap as Charles
the Simple. He consented, indeed, to swear allegiance,
and declare himself the "king's man," with his hands
clasped between those of Charles. The remaining part
of the ceremony, the kneeling to kiss the foot of the liege
lord, he absolutely refused, and was with difficulty persuaded
to permit one of his followers to perform it in his
name. The proxy, as proud as his master, instead of
kneeling, took the king's foot in his hand, and lifted it
to his mouth while he stood upright, thus overturning
both monarch and throne, amid the rude laughter of his
companions, while the miserable Charles and his courtiers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
felt such a dread of these new vassals that they did not
dare resent the insult.</p>

<p>16. On his return to Rouen, Rollo was baptized, and,
on leaving the cathedral, celebrated his conversion by
large grants to the different churches and convents of his
duchy, making a fresh gift on each of the days during
which he wore the white robes of the newly baptized.
All of his warriors who chose to follow his example, and
embrace the Christian faith, received from him grants of
land, to be held of him on the same terms as those by
which he held the dukedom from the king. The country
thus peopled by the Northmen, gradually assumed the
name of Normandy.</p>

<p>17. Applying themselves with all the ardor of their
temper to their new way of life, the Northmen quickly
adopted the manners, language, and habits which were
recommended to them as connected with the holy faith
which they had just embraced, but without losing their
own bold and vigorous spirit. Soon the gallant and accomplished
Norman knight could scarcely have been recognized
as the savage sea-robber, while, at the same time,
he bore as little resemblance to the cruel and voluptuous
French noble, at once violent and indolent.</p>

<p>18. There is no doubt, however, that the keen, unsophisticated
vigor of Rollo, directed by his new religion
did great good in Normandy, and that his justice was
sharp, his discipline impartial, so that of him is told the
famous old story bestowed upon other just princes, that a
gold bracelet was left for three years untouched upon a tree
in a forest. He had been married, as part of the treaty, to
GisÃ¨le, a daughter of King Charles the Simple, but he was
an old grizzly warrior, and neither cared for the other.
A wife whom he had long before taken, had borne him a
son, named William, to whom he left his dukedom in 932.</p>

<h2><i>XXXIX.&mdash;THE TRUE STORY OF MACBETH.</i></h2>

<p>1. In the north of Scotland, where the cliffs bordering
Moray Firth face the auroral heavens, are two ancient
towns, Inverness and Forres, whose names are immortalized
in Shakespeare's great tragedy of Macbeth,
for it is in their vicinity that most of its scenes are laid.</p>

<p>2. It is a wild, lonely country, and must have been
wilder and lonelier still eight hundred years ago, when
from the neighboring Norway coast the black boats of
the vikings, or North Sea rovers, used to come flocking
into the quiet harbors of Moray and Cromarty Firths,
like so many swift birds of prey swooping suddenly in
from the gray horizon, snatching their plunder and flitting
away on never-resting wings only to return in greater
numbers and depart with richer booty.</p>

<p>3. In 1033&ndash;1039, when the sons of Canute the Dane
were wearing the English crown, and not long after a few
of the roving Norsemen had drifted away to plant a little
history and a great mystery across the wide Atlantic, there
reigned in Scotland a king by the name of Duncan MacCrinan.
Among his nobles was a certain Macbeth, Thane
of Glamis, about whom a great many stories are told,
some of which would no doubt have made their subject
open his eyes, for if we may credit the sober historians
he was rather respectable than otherwise, and probably
slept much better o' nights than Mr. Shakespeare would
have us believe. It is even said that he made a pilgrimage
to Rome and saw the Pope, which certainly ought to
establish his virtue to anybody's satisfaction.</p>

<p>4. At all events he was a brave soldier and able general,
and Duncan naturally thought that he had the right
man in the right place when he gave him command of
the royal army and sent him off to drive out Thorfinn
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and Thorkell, two Norse chiefs who had come over to
conquer Scotland.</p>

<p>5. Macbeth had wedded a lady named Grnoch MacB&oelig;dhe,
which made him cousin to the king, and very
likely put strange notions into his head, even if they never
were there before. He was what we call "a rising man,"
and so, having gloriously defeated Thorfinn and Thorkell,
or, some say, making them allies, he gloriously turned
around and made war upon Duncan MacCrinan. In this
struggle Duncan was killed or mortally wounded near
Elgin, on Moray Firth, and Macbeth usurped the throne.</p>

<p>6. Others claim that Thorfinn had conquered that
part of Scotland, that Macbeth was his vassal and merely
fulfilled his duty to his over-lord in repelling an invasion
by Duncan, in which the latter deservedly met the
common fate of war.</p>

<p>7. It is very difficult to learn the real truth about people
who lived before history was anything more than oral
tradition, because, as in the case of Macbeth, a great many
legends gradually clustered about their names, which were
not committed to writing until many, many years after
the events actually occurred. The very earliest Scotch
writing ever discovered is only a charter, and is dated
1095, more than fifty years after Duncan was "in his
grave," and it was more than three hundred years later
that a Scotch prior, named Androwe of Wyntonne, wrote
a long historical poem which he called an Orygynale
Cronykil of Scotland. In it he relates the story of Macbeth
and the three witches, and the murder of Duncan,
though he says that Macbeth afterward made a very wise
and just king, whose reign of seventeen years was marked
by great abundance, and by royal almsgiving and zeal for
"holy kirk."</p>

<p>8. But a Latin history of Scotland, written about a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
hundred years before Shakespeare by an Aberdeen professor,
and translated into English under the title of Holinshed's
Chronicle, supplied the great dramatist with his
plot, though it suited his purpose to combine the true
story of Macbeth with the murder of an earlier king.
Then, adding a great deal about ghosts and witches, and,
above all, breathing into these dry, long-dead mummies
the quickening breath of genius, the immortal playwright
recreated a Macbeth who seems a far more real and living
character than many of our contemporaries.</p>

<p>9. By whatever means Macbeth secured the throne,
history and fiction agree as to the manner of his losing it.
Duncan's sons, in reality mere infants at their father's
death, were hurried away by their friends, and Malcolm,
the elder, was committed to his mother's brother, Siward,
Earl of Northumbria, who in good time aided his young
kinsman to recover his birthright.</p>

<p>10. Macbeth, notwithstanding his prosperous reign, was
regarded as a usurper, and was consequently very unpopular
with the loyal Scotch, who, though proud and quarrelsome,
were always devotedly true where they recognized
an obligation of fealty. So when Malcolm returned
they flocked around the beloved young heir, and defeated
his enemy at Dunsinane, though Macbeth was not killed
at this place, as Shakespeare says, but fled across the
Grampians to rally at Lumphanan. Here he was slain
and the victorious Malcolm&mdash;called in history Malcolm
Canmore&mdash;now went to Scone and was crowned upon a
famous stone, believed by the Scotch to be the same that
Jacob used for his pillow. It is certainly the one that
Edward I of England afterward took away and made the
seat of the coronation chair at Westminster Abbey, where
it is still to be seen.</p>

<p>11. But, like many another evil that has been wrought
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
before now, Macbeth's treason resulted in the ultimate
good of his country; for Malcolm, during his long exile,
had become accustomed to the superior civilization of the
English, and now introduced many improvements among
his subjects. Having known, too, the sorrows of a fugitive,
he welcomed to his court the Saxon princes fleeing
from Norman William, among whom was Margaret Atheling,
the gentle granddaughter of Edmund Ironsides, who
became his bride, and whose winning graces went far
toward refining the rude manners of the warlike Scots.
One of their sons was the saintly King David, who founded
Melrose Abbey, and who is said to have been to Scotland
"all that Alfred was to England, and more than
Louis was to France."</p>

<p>12. Another noble, called Banquo, seems to have had
some part in Duncan's overthrow, but as the play of
Macbeth was written in the reign of James I, who was a
Scot and traced his descent back to Banquo, it was not
deemed prudent or polite to represent the character in an
unflattering light; so he was pictured as noble and incorruptible,
and was so unfortunate, poor man, as to have to
be murdered to make the story end well.</p>

<p>13. Sir Walter Scott, in his "Tales of a Grandfather,"
gives us a story differing little from the outline of Shakespeare's
drama, but then, who that has spent enraptured
hours over Rob Roy and the Black Dwarf could wish the
charming wizard to spoil a good story for the sake of
mere historical exactness? not I, surely! And the Macbeth
of history, no matter how zealously we may try to
discover him, or how faithfully we may attempt, at this
late day, to reconstruct his damaged reputation, he can
never be to us anything better than a very misty tradition.
Whatever he may have been eight hundred
years ago, the Macbeth <i>we</i> know, the only real Macbeth
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
there is or ever can be, is after all the one that met the
witches in the thunder-storm on Forres Heath and then
went home and murdered the gentle old king who "had
so much blood in him," and a moment later, startled by
the knocking at the gate, exclaimed in bitterest remorse:
"Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou
could'st!"</p>

<p>14. If you read this scene in the silent hours when
every one else in the house is sleeping, you will almost
believe that you murdered Duncan yourself, and that you
hear Lady Macbeth's hoarse whisper in your ear: "To
bed, to bed, there's knocking at the gate. Come, come,
come, come, give me your hand. What's done can not
be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed."</p>

<p>15. Then you will shut the book in sudden terror of
the lonely midnight, and scramble into bed with the
blood curdling in your veins, and presently, aided by the
darkness, your imagination will bridge the gulf of centuries,
and you will seem to see a long vaulted hall in a
mediÃ¦val palace, and in the hall a banquet spread, around
which gather lords of high degree, while on the canopied
dais at the upper end sit King Macbeth and his white-haired,
pitiless, guilty queen. And from the rainy outer
darkness you may catch the faint echo of a mortal cry:
"Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!" And then as you picture
the king stepping down from his royal seat to meet
a blood-stained murderer at the door, you will have a momentary
glimpse of Banquo lying in the roadside ditch
"with twenty trenchÃ©d gashes in his head," and of Fleance
speeding away alone through the stormy night.</p>

<h2><i>XL.&mdash;DUKE WILLIAM OF NORMANDY.</i></h2>

<p>1. Now Duke William was in his park at Rouen,
and in his hands he held a bow ready strung, for he was
going hunting, and many knights and squires with him.
And behold, there came to the gate a messenger from
England; and he went straight to the duke and drew
him aside, and told him secretly how King Edward's life
had come to an end, and Harold had been made king in
his stead. And when the duke had heard the tidings,
and understood all that was come to pass, those that
looked upon him perceived that he was greatly enraged,
for he forsook the chase, and went in silence, speaking no
word to any man, clasping and unclasping his cloak,
neither dared any man speak to him; but he crossed
over the Seine in a boat, and went to his hall, and sat
down on a bench; and he covered his face with his mantle,
and leaned down his head, and there he abode, turning
about restlessly for one hour after another in gloomy
thought. And none dared speak a word to him, but they
spake to one another, saying: "What ails the duke?
Why bears he such a mien?"</p>

<p>2. "That is it that troubles me," said the duke. "I
grieve because Edward is dead, and that Harold has done
me a wrong; for he has taken my kingdom who was
bound to me by oath and promise." To these words answered
Fitz-Osbern the bold: "Sir, tarry not, but make
ready with speed to avenge yourself on Harold, who has
been disloyal to you; for if you lack not courage, there
will be left no land to Harold. Summon all whom you
may summon, cross the sea and seize his lands; for no
brave man should begin a matter and not carry it on to
the end."</p>

<p>3. Then William sent messengers to Harold to call
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
upon him to keep the oath that he had sworn; but Harold
replied in scorn that he would not marry his
daughter, nor give up his land to him. And William
sent to him his defiance; but Harold answered that he
feared him not, and he drove all the Normans out of the
land, with their wives and children, for King Edward had
given them lands and castles, but Harold chased them out
of the country; neither would he let one remain. And
at Christmas he took the crown, but it would have been
well for himself and his land if he had not been crowned,
since for the kingdom he perjured himself, and his reign
lasted but a short space.</p>

<p>4. Then Duke William called together his barons,
and told them all his will, and how Harold had wronged
him, and that he would cross the sea and revenge himself;
but without their aid he could not gather men enough,
nor a large navy; therefore, he would know of each one
of them how many men and ships he would bring. And
they prayed for leave to take counsel together, and the
duke granted their request. And their deliberations
lasted long, for many complained that their burdens were
heavy, and some said that they would bring ships and
cross the sea with the duke, and others said they would
not go, for they were in debt and poor. Thus some
would and some would not, and there was great contention
between them.</p>

<p>5. Then Fitz-Osbern came to them and said: "Wherefore
dispute you, sirs? Ye should not fail your natural
lord when he goes seeking honors. Ye owe him service
for your fiefs, and where ye owe service ye should serve
with all your power. Ask not delay, nor wait until he
prays you; but go before, and offer him more than you
can do. Let him not lament that his enterprise failed
for your remissness." But they answered: "Sir, we fear
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the sea, and we owe no service across the sea. Speak for
us, we pray you, and answer in our stead. Say what you
will, and we will abide by your words." "Will ye all
leave yourselves to me?" he said. And each one answered:
"Yes. Let us go to the duke, and you shall
speak for us."</p>

<p>6. And Fitz-Osbern turned himself about and went
before him to the duke, and spoke for them, and he said:
"Sir, no lord has such men as you have, and who will
do so much for their lord's honor, and you ought to love
and keep them well. For you they say they would be
drowned in the sea or thrown into the fire. You may
trust them well, for they have served you long and followed
you at great cost. And if they have done well,
they will do better; for they will pass the sea with you,
and will double their service. For he who should bring
twenty knights will gladly bring forty, and he who should
serve you thirty will bring sixty, and he from whom one
hundred is due will willingly bring two hundred. And
I, in loving loyalty, will bring in my lord's business sixty
ships, well arrayed and laden with fighting men."</p>

<p>7. But the barons marveled at him, and murmured
aloud at the words that he spake and the promises he
made, for which they had given him no warrant. And
many contradicted him, and there arose a noise and loud
disturbance among them; for they feared that if they
doubled their service it would become a custom, and be
turned into a feudal right. And the noise and outcry
became so great that a man could not hear what his fellow
said. Then the duke went aside, for the noise displeased
him, and sent for the barons one by one, and
spoke to each one of the greatness of the enterprise, and
that if they would double their service, and do freely
more than their due, it should be well for them, and that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
he would never make it a custom, nor require of them
any service more than was the usage of the country, and
such as their ancestors had paid to their lord. Then each
one said he would do it, and he told how many ships he
would bring, and the duke had them all written down in
brief. Bishop Odo, his brother, brought him forty ships,
and the Bishop of Le Mans prepared thirty, with their
mariners and pilots. And the duke prayed his neighbors
of Brittany, Anjou, and Maine, Ponthieu, and Boulogne,
to aid him in this business; and he promised them lands
if England were conquered, and rich gifts and large pay.
Thus from all sides came soldiers to him.</p>

<p>8. Then he showed the matter to his lord the King of
France, and he sought him at St. Germer, and found him
there; and he said that he would aid him, so that by his
aid he won his right, he would hold England from him
and serve him for it. But the king answered that he
would not aid him, neither with his will should he pass
the sea; for the French prayed him not to aid him, saying
he was too strong already, and that if he let him add
riches from over the sea to his lands of Normandy and all
his good knights, there would never be peace. "And
when England shall be conquered," said they, "you will
hear no more of his service. He pays little service now,
but then it will be less. The more he has, the less he
will do."</p>

<p>9. So the duke took leave of the king, and came away
in a rage, saying: "Sir, I go to do the best I can, and if
God will that I gain my right you shall see me no more
but for evil. And if I fail, and the English can defend
themselves, my children shall inherit my lands, and thou
shalt not conquer them. Living or dead, I fear no menace!"</p>

<p>10. Then the duke sent to Rome clerks that were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
skilled in speech, and they told the Pope how Harold had
sworn falsely, and that Duke William promised that if he
conquered England he would hold it of St. Peter. And
the Pope sent him a standard and a very precious ring,
and underneath the stone there was, it is said, a hair of
St. Peter's. And about that time there appeared a great
star shining in the south with very long rays, such a star
as is seen when a kingdom is about to have a new king.
I have spoken with many men who saw it, and those who
are cunning in the stars call it a comet.</p>

<p>11. Then the duke called together carpenters and
ship-builders, and in all the ports of Normandy there was
sawing of planks and carrying of wood, spreading of sails
and setting up of masts, with great labor and industry.
Thus all the summer long and through the month of
August they made ready the fleet and assembled the men;
for there was no knight in all the land, nor any good
sergeant, nor archer, nor any peasant of good courage, of
age to fight, whom the duke did not summon to go with
him to England.</p>

<p>12. When the ships were ready, they were anchored
in the Somme at St. Valery. And as the renown of the
duke went abroad there came to him soldiers one by one
or two by two, and the duke kept them with him, and
promised them much. And some asked for lands in
England, and others pay and large gifts. But I will not
write down what barons, knights, and soldiers the duke
had in his company; but I have heard my father say (I
remember it well, though I was but a boy) that there
were seven hundred ships, save four, when they left St.
Valery&mdash;ships, and boats, and little skiffs. But I found
it written (I know not the truth) that there were three
thousand ships carrying sails and masts.</p>

<p>13. And at St. Valery they tarried long for a favorable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
wind, and the barons grew weary with waiting; and
they prayed those of the convent to bring out to the camp
the shrine of St. Valery, and they came to it and prayed
they might cross the sea, and they offered money till all
the holy body was covered with it, and the same day
there sprang up a favorable wind. Then the duke put a
lantern on the mast of his ship, that the other ships might
see it and keep their course near, and an ensign of gilded
copper on the top; and at the head of the ships, which
mariners call the prow, there was a child made of copper
holding a bow and arrow, and he had his face toward
England, and seemed about to shoot.</p>

<p>14. Thus the ships came to port, and they all arrived
together and anchored together on the beach, and together
they all disembarked. And it was near Hastings, and the
ships lay side by side. And the good sailors and sergeants
and esquires sprang out, and cast anchor, and fastened
the ships with ropes; and they brought out their
shields and saddles, and led forth the horses.</p>

<p>15. The archers were the first to come to land, every
one with his bow and his quiver and arrows by his side,
all shaven and dressed in short tunics, ready for battle
and of good courage; and they searched all the beach,
but no armed man could they find. When they were
issued forth, then came the knights in armor, with helmet
laced and shield on neck, and together they came to the
sand and mounted their war-horses; and they had their
swords at their sides, and rode with lances raised. The
barons had their standards and the knights their pennons.
After them came the carpenters, with their axes in their
hands and their tools hanging by their side. And when
they came to the archers and to the knights they took
counsel together, and brought wood from the ships and
fastened it together with bolts and bars, and before the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
evening was well come they had made themselves a strong
fort. And they lighted fires and cooked food, and the
duke and his barons and knights sat down to eat; and
they all ate and drank plentifully and rejoiced that they
were come to land.</p>

<p>16. When the duke came forth of his ship he fell on
his hands to the ground, and there rose a great cry, for all
said it was an evil sign; but he cried aloud: "Lords, I
have seized the land with my two hands, and will never
yield it. All is ours." Then a man ran to land and laid
his hand upon a cottage, and took a handful of the thatch,
and returned to the duke. "Sir," said he, "take seizin
of the land; yours is the land without doubt." Then the
duke commanded the mariners to draw all the ships to
land and pierce holes in them and break them to pieces,
for they should never return by the way they had come.</p>

<h2><i>XLI.&mdash;THE NORMAN CONQUEST.</i></h2>

<p>1. Poor old Edward the Confessor, holy, weak, and
sad, lay in his new choir of Westminster&mdash;where the
wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.
The crowned ascetic had left no heir behind. England
seemed as a corpse, to which all the eagles might gather
together; and the South-English, in their utter need, had
chosen for their king the ablest, and it may be the justest,
man in Britain&mdash;Earl Harold Godwinson: himself,
like half the upper classes of England then, of all-dominant
Norse blood; for his mother was a Danish princess.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="caption2"><i>Edward the Confessor's Tomb.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Then out of Norway, with a mighty host, came
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 218]<br />[Pg 219]</a></span>
Harold Hardraade, taller than all men, the ideal Viking
of his time. He had been away to Russia to King Jaroslaf;
he had been in the Emperor's Varanger guard at
Constantinople&mdash;and, it was whispered, had slain a lion
there with his bare hands; he had carved his name and
his comrades' in Runic characters&mdash;if you go to Venice
you may see them at this day&mdash;on the loins of the great
marble lion, which stood in his time not in Venice but in
Athens. And now, King of Norway and conqueror, for
the time, of Denmark, why should he not take England,
as Sweyn and Canute took it sixty years before, when
the flower of the English gentry perished at the fatal battle
of Assingdune? If he and his half-barbarous host had
conquered, the civilization of Britain would have been
thrown back, perhaps, for centuries. But it was not to be.</p>

<p>3. England <i>was</i> to be conquered by the Normans;
but by the civilized, not the barbaric; by the Norse who
had settled, but four generations before, in the northeast
of France under Rou, Rollo, Rolf the Ganger, so called,
they say, because his legs were so long that, when on
horseback, he touched the ground and seemed to gang, or
walk. He and his Norsemen had taken their share of
France, and called it Normandy to this day; and meanwhile,
with that docility and adaptability which marks so
often truly great spirits, they changed their creed, their
language, their habits, and had become, from heathen
and murderous Berserkers, the most truly civilized people
in Europe, and&mdash;as was most natural then&mdash;the most
faithful allies and servants of the Pope of Rome. So
greatly had they changed, and so fast, that William Duke
of Normandy, the great-great grandson of Rolf the wild
Viking, was perhaps the finest gentleman, as well as the
most cultivated sovereign and the greatest statesman and
warrior in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
    4. So Harold of Norway came with all his Vikings to
Stamford Bridge by York; and took, by coming, only
that which Harold of England promised him, namely,
"forasmuch as he was taller than any other man, seven
feet of English ground."</p>

<p>5. The story of that great battle, told with a few inaccuracies,
but as only great poets tell, you should read, if
you have not read it already, in the "Heimskringla" of
Snorri Sturluson, the Homer of the North:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High feast that day held the birds of the air and the beasts of the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White-tailed erm and sallow glede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dusky raven, with horny neb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gray deer the wolf of the wood.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The bones of the slain, men say, whitened the place for
fifty years to come.</p>

<p>6. And remember that on the same day on which
that fight befell&mdash;September 27, 1066&mdash;William, Duke of
Normandy, with all his French-speaking Norsemen, was
sailing across the British Channel, under the protection
of a banner consecrated by the Pope, to conquer that
England which the Norse-speaking Normans could not
conquer.</p>

<p>7. And now King Harold showed himself a man.
He turned at once from the north of England to the
south. He raised the folk of the southern, as he had
raised those of the central and northern shires, and in
sixteen days&mdash;after a march which in those times was a
prodigious feat&mdash;he was intrenched upon the fatal down
which men called Heathfield then, and Senlac, but Battle
to this day&mdash;with William and his French Normans opposite
him on Telham Hill.</p>

<p>8. Then came the battle of Hastings. You all know
what befell upon that day, and how the old weapon was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
matched against the new&mdash;the English axe against the
Norman lance&mdash;and beaten only because the English
broke their ranks.</p>

<p>9. It was a fearful time which followed. I can not
but believe that our forefathers had been, in some way or
other, great sinners, or two such conquests as Canute's
and William's would not have fallen on them within the
short space of sixty years. They did not want for courage,
as Stamford Brigg and Hastings showed full well.
English swine, their Norman conquerors called them often
enough, but never English cowards.</p>

<p>10. Their ruinous vice, if we trust the records of the
time, was what the old monks called <i>accidia</i>, and ranked
it as one of the seven deadly sins: a general careless,
sleepy, comfortable habit of mind, which lets all go its
way for good or evil&mdash;a habit of mind too often accompanied,
as in the case of the Anglo-Danes, with self-indulgence,
often coarse enough. Huge eaters and huger
drinkers, fuddled with ale, were the men who went down
at Hastings&mdash;though they went down like heroes&mdash;before
the staid and sober Norman out of France.</p>

<p>11. But these were fearful times. As long as William
lived, ruthless as he was to all rebels, he kept order and
did justice with a strong and steady hand; for he brought
with him from Normandy the instincts of a truly great
statesman. And in his sons' time matters grew worse and
worse. After that, in the troubles of Stephen's reign,
anarchy let loose tyranny in its most fearful form, and
things were done which recall the cruelties of the old
Spanish <i>conquistadores</i> in America. Scott's charming
romance of "Ivanhoe" must be taken, I fear, as a too true
picture of English society in the time of Richard I.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 <p class="caption2"><i>Battle Abbey.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12. And what came of it all? What was the result
of all this misery and wrong? This, paradoxical as it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 222]<br />[Pg 223]</a></span>
may seem: that the Norman conquest was the making of
the English people; of the free commons of England.</p>

<p>13. Paradoxical, but true. First, you must dismiss
from your minds the too common notion that there is
now in England a governing Norman aristocracy, or that
there has been one, at least since the year 1215, when the
Magna Charta was won from the Norman John by Normans
and by English alike. For the first victors at Hastings,
like the first <i>conquistadores</i> in America, perished, as
the monk chronicles point out, rapidly by their own
crimes; and very few of our nobility can trace their names
back to the authentic Battle Abbey roll.</p>

<p>14. The cause is plain: The conquest of England by
the Normans was not one of those conquests of a savage
by a civilized race, or of a cowardly race by a brave race,
which results in the slavery of the conquered, and leaves
the gulf of caste between two races&mdash;master and slave.
The vast majority, all but the whole population of England,
have always been free, and free as they are not
when caste exists to change their occupations. They
could intermarry, if they were able men, into the rank
above them; as they could sink, if they were unable men,
into the rank below them.</p>

<p>15. Nay, so utterly made up now is the old blood-feud
between Norman and Englishman, between the descendants
of those who conquered and those who were
conquered, that, in the children of the Prince of Wales,
after eight hundred years, the blood of William of Normandy
is mingled with the blood of Harold, who fell at
Hastings. And so, by the bitter woes which followed the
Norman conquest was the whole population, Dane, Angle,
and Saxon, earl and churl, freeman and slave, crushed
and welded together into one homogeneous mass, made
just and merciful toward each other by the most wholesome
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
of all teachings, a community of suffering; and if
they had been, as I fear they were, a lazy and a sensual
people, were taught&mdash;</p>

<h2><i>XLII.&mdash;KING RICHARD C&OElig;UR DE LION IN<br />
THE HOLY LAND.</i></h2>

<p>1. At the end of August, 1191, Richard led his crusading
troops from Acre into the midst of the wilderness
of Mount Carmel, where their sufferings were terrible;
the rocky, sandy, and uneven ground was covered with
bushes full of long, sharp prickles, and swarms of noxious
insects buzzed in the air, fevering the Europeans with
their stings; and in addition to these natural obstacles,
multitudes of Arab horsemen harrassed them on every
side, slaughtering every straggler who dropped behind
from fatigue, and attacking them so unceasingly that it
was remarked, that throughout their day's track there
was not one space of four feet without an arrow sticking
in the ground. Richard fought indefatigably, always in
the van, and ready to reward the gallant exploits of his
knights. A young knight who bore a white shield, in
hopes of gaining some honorable bearing, so distinguished
himself that Richard thus greeted him at the close of the
day: "Maiden knight, you have borne yourself as a lion,
and done the deed of six crusaders."</p>

was fought. Saladin and his brother had almost defeated
the two religious orders (the Templars and the Hospitallers),
and the gallant French knight Jacques d'Avesne,
after losing his leg by a stroke from a cimeter, fought
bravely on, calling on the English king until he fell overpowered
by numbers. C&oelig;ur de Lion and Guillaume des
Barres retrieved the day, hewed down the enemy on all
sides, and remained masters of the field. It is even said
that Richard and Saladin met hand to hand, but this is
uncertain. This victory opened the way to Joppa, where
the crusaders spent the next month in the repair of the
fortifications, while the Saracen forces lay at Ascalon.</p>

<p>3. While here, Richard often amused himself with
hawking, and one day was asleep under a tree when he
was aroused by the approach of a party of Saracens, and
springing on his horse Frannelle, which had been taken
at Cyprus, he rashly pursued them and fell into an ambush.
Four knights were slain, and he would have been
seized had not a Gascon knight named Guillaume des
Parcelets called out that he himself was the Malak Rik
(great king), and allowed himself to be taken. Richard
offered ten noble Saracens in exchange for this generous
knight, whom Saladin restored together with a valuable
horse that had been captured at the same time. A present
of another Arab steed accompanied them; but Richard's
half-brother, William Longsword, insisted on trying the
animal before the king should mount it. No sooner was
he on its back, than it dashed at once across the country,
and before he could stop it he found himself in the midst
of the enemy's camp. The two Saracen princes were extremely
shocked and distressed lest this should be supposed
a trick, and instantly escorted Longsword back
with a gift of three chargers, which proved to be more
manageable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
    4. From Joppa the crusaders marched to Ramla, and
thence, on New Year's Day, 1192, set out for Jerusalem
through a country full of greater obstacles than they had
yet encountered. They were too full of spirit to be discouraged
until they came to Bethany, where the two
Grand Masters represented to Richard the imprudence of
laying siege to such fortifications as those of Jerusalem at
such a season of the year, while Ascalon was ready in his
rear for a post whence the enemy would attack him.</p>

<p>5. He yielded, and retreated to Ascalon, which Saladin
had ruined and abandoned, and began eagerly to repair
the fortifications so as to be able to leave a garrison there.
The soldiers grumbled, saying they had not come to Palestine
to build Ascalon, but to conquer Jerusalem; whereupon
Richard set the example of himself carrying stones,
and called on Leopold, the Duke of Austria, to do the
same. The sulky reply, "He was not the son of a mason,"
so irritated Richard, that he struck him a blow;
Leopold straightway quitted the army, and returned to
Austria.</p>

<p>6. It was not without great grief and many struggles
that C&oelig;ur de Lion finally gave up his hopes of taking
Jerusalem. He again advanced as far as Bethany; but a
quarrel with Hugh of Burgundy, and the defection of
the Austrians made it impossible for him to proceed, and
he turned back to Ramla. While riding out with a party
of knights, one of them called out, "This way, my lord,
and you will see Jerusalem." "Alas!" said Richard,
hiding his face with his mantle, "those who are not
worthy to win the Holy City are not worthy to behold
it." He returned to Acre; but there hearing that Saladin
was besieging Joppa, he embarked his troops and
sailed to its aid.</p>

<p>7. The crescent (the standard of the Saracens) shone
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
on its walls as he entered the harbor; but while he looked
on in dismay, he was hailed by a priest who had leaped
into the sea and swum out to inform him that there was
yet time to rescue the garrison, though the town was in
the hands of the enemy. He hurried his vessel forward,
leaped into the water breast-high, dashed upward on the
shore, ordered his immediate followers to raise a bulwark
of casks and beams to protect the landing of the rest,
and rushing up a flight of steps, entered the city alone.
"St. George! St. George!" That cry dismayed the infidels,
and those in the town to the number of three thousand
fled in the utmost confusion, and were pursued for
two miles by three knights who had been fortunate enough
to find him.</p>

<p>8. Richard pitched his tent outside the walls, and remained
there with so few troops that all were contained
in ten tents. Very early one morning, before the king
was out of bed, a man rushed into his tent, crying out:
"O king! we are all dead men!" Springing up, Richard
fiercely silenced him: "Peace! or thou diest by my
hand!" Then, while hastily donning his suit of mail, he
heard that the glitter of arms had been seen in the distance,
and in another moment the enemy were upon them,
seven thousand in number. Richard had neither helmet
nor shield, and only seventeen of his knights had horses;
but undaunted he drew up his little force in a compact
body, the knights kneeling on one knee covered by their
shields, their lances pointing outward, and between each
pair an archer with an assistant to load his cross-bow; and
he stood in the midst encouraging them with his voice, and
threatening to cut off the head of the first who turned to
fly. In vain did the Saracens charge that mass of brave
men, not one seventh of their number; the shields and
lances were impenetrable; and without one forward step
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
or one bolt from the cross-bows, their passive steadiness
turned back wave after wave of the enemy.</p>

<p>9. At last the king gave the word for the cross-bowmen
to advance, while he, with the seventeen mounted knights
charged, lance in rest. His curtal axe bore down all before
it, and he dashed like lightning from one part of the
plain to another, with not a moment to smile at the opportune
gift from the polite Malek-el-Afdal, who, in the
hottest of the fight, sent him two fine horses, desiring him
to use them in escaping from this dreadful peril. Little
did the Saracen princes imagine that they would find him
victorious, and that they would mount two more pursuers!</p>

<p>10. Next came a terrified fugitive with news that
three thousand Saracens had entered Joppa! Richard
summoned a few knights, and without a word to the rest
galloped back into the city. The panic inspired by his
presence instantly cleared the streets, and riding back, he
again led his troops to the charge; but such were the
swarms of Saracens, that it was not till evening that the
Christians could give themselves a moment's rest, or look
round and feel that they had gained one of the most wonderful
of victories. Since daybreak Richard had not laid
aside his sword or axe, and his hand was all over blistered.
No wonder that the terror of his name endured for centuries
in Palestine, and that the Arab chided his starting
horse with, "Dost think that yonder is the Malek Rik?"
while the mother stilled her crying child by threats that
the Malek Rik should take it.</p>

<p>11. These violent exertions seriously injured Richard's
health, and a low fever placed him in great danger, as
well as several of his best knights. No command or persuasion
could induce the rest to commence any enterprise
without him, and the tidings from Europe induced him
to conclude a peace and return home. Malek-el-Afdal
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
came to visit him, and a truce was signed for three years,
three months, three weeks, three days, three hours, and
three minutes, thus so quaintly arranged in accordance with
some astrological views of the Saracens. Ascalon was to
be demolished on condition that free access to Jerusalem
was to be allowed to the pilgrims; but Saladin would not
restore the piece of the True Cross, as he was resolved
not to conduce to what he considered idolatry.</p>

<p>12. Richard sent notice that he was coming back with
double his present force to effect the conquest, and the
Sultan answered, that if the Holy City was to pass into
Frank hands, none could be nobler than those of the
Malek Rik. Fever and debility detained Richard a month
longer at Joppa, during which time he sent the Bishop of
Salisbury to carry his offerings to Jerusalem. The prelate
was invited to the presence of Saladin, who spoke in high
terms of Richard's courage, but censured his rash exposure
of his own life. On October 9, 1193, C&oelig;ur de Lion
took leave of Palestine, watching with tears its receding
shores, as he exclaimed, "O, Holy Land, I commend thee
and thy people unto God. May He grant me yet to return
to aid thee!"</p>

<h2><i>XLIII.&mdash;KING JOHN AND THE CHARTER.</i></h2>

<p>1. On his return from the crusade Richard was taken
prisoner by the Duke of Austria. He bought his release
only to find King Philip attacking his French dominions,
and to plunge into wearisome and indecisive wars, in the
midst of which he was slain at the Castle of Chaluz. His
brother John, who followed him on the throne, was a vile
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
and weak ruler, under whom the great sovereignty built
up by Henry II broke utterly down. Normandy, Maine,
and Anjou were reft from him by Philip of France, and
only Aquitaine remained to him on that side of the sea.
In England his lust and oppression drove people and nobles
to join in resistance to him; and their resistance
found a great leader in the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Stephen Langton.</p>

<p>2. From the moment of his landing in England, Stephen
Langton had taken up the constitutional position of
the primate in upholding the old customs and rights of
the realm against the personal despotism of the kings.
As Anselm had withstood William the Red, as Theobald
had withstood Stephen, so Langton prepared to withstand
and rescue his country from the tyranny of John.
He had already forced him to swear to observe the laws
of Edward the Confessor, in other words the traditional
liberties of the realm. When the baronage refused to
sail for Poitou, saying that they owed service to him in
England, but not in foreign lands, he compelled the king
to deal with them not by arms, but by process of law.
But the work which he now undertook was far greater and
weightier than this. The pledges of Henry the First had
long been forgotten when the justiciar brought them to
light, but Langton saw the vast importance of such a precedent.
At the close of the month he produced Henry's
charter in a fresh gathering of barons at St. Paul's, and it
was at once welcomed as a base for the needed reforms.
From London Langton hastened to the king, whom he
reached at Northampton on his way to attack the nobles
of the north, and wrested from him a promise to bring
his strife with them to legal judgment before assailing
them in arms.</p>

<p>3. With his enemies gathering abroad, John had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
doubtless no wish to be entangled in a long quarrel at
home, and the archbishop's mediation allowed him to
withdraw with seeming dignity. After a demonstration
therefore at Durham John marched hastily south again,
and reached London in October. His justiciar Geoffry
Fitz-Peter at once laid before him the claims of the Council
of St. Alban's and St. Paul's, but the death of Geoffry
at this juncture freed him from the pressure which
his minister was putting upon him. "Now, by God's feet,"
cried John, "I am for the first time king and lord of
England," and he intrusted the vacant justiciarship to a
Poitevin, Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester,
whose temper was in harmony with his own. But the
death of Geoffry only called the archbishop to the front,
and Langton at once demanded the king's assent to the
charter of Henry the First.</p>

<p>4. In seizing on this charter as a basis for national
action, Langton showed a political ability of the highest
order. The enthusiasm with which its recital was welcomed
showed the sagacity with which the archbishop
had chosen his ground. From that moment the baronage
was no longer drawn together in secret conspiracies by a
sense of common wrong or a vague longing for common
deliverance; they were openly united in a definite claim
of national freedom and national law. Secretly, and on
the pretext of pilgrimage, the nobles met at St. Edmundsbury,
resolute to bear no longer with John's delays. If
he refused to restore their liberties they swore to make
war on him till he confirmed them by charter under the
king's seal, and they parted to raise forces with the purpose
of presenting their demands at Christmas. John,
knowing nothing of the coming storm, pursued his policy
of winning over the Church by granting it freedom of
election, while he imbittered still more the strife with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
his nobles by demanding scutage<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> from the northern nobles
who had refused to follow him to Poitou. But the
barons were now ready to act, and early in January, in
the memorable year 1215, they appeared in arms to lay,
as they had planned, their demands before the king.</p>

<p>5. John was taken by surprise. He asked for a truce
till Easter-tide, and spent the interval in fevered efforts to
avoid the blow. Again he offered freedom to the Church,
and took vows as a crusader against whom war was a sacrilege,
while he called for a general oath of allegiance
and fealty from the whole body of his subjects. But
month after month only showed the king the uselessness
of further resistance. Though Pandulf, the Pope's legate,
was with him, his vassalage had as yet brought little fruit
in the way of aid from Rome; the commissioners whom
he sent to plead his cause at the shire courts brought back
news that no man would help him against the charter
that the barons claimed; and his efforts to detach the
clergy from the league of his opponents utterly failed.
The nation was against the king. He was far indeed
from being utterly deserted. His ministers still clung to
him, men such as Geoffry de Lucy, Geoffry de Furnival,
Thomas Basset, and William Briwere, statesmen trained
in the administrative school of his father, and who, dissent
as they might from John's mere oppression, still
looked on the power of the crown as the one barrier
against feudal anarchy; and beside them stood some of
the great nobles of royal blood, Earl William of Salisbury,
his cousin Earl William of Warenne, and Henry, Earl of
Cornwall, a grandson of Henry the First. With him too remained
Ranulf, Earl of Chester, and the wisest and noblest
of the barons, William Marshal, the elder Earl of Pembroke.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
William Marshal had shared in the rising of the
younger Henry against Henry II, and stood by him as he
died; he had shared in the overthrow of William Longchamp,
and in the outlawry of John. He was now an
old man, firm, as we shall see in his aftercourse, to recall
the government to the path of freedom and law, but
shrinking from a strife which might bring back the anarchy
of Stephen's day, and looking for reforms rather in
the bringing constitutional pressure to bear upon the king
than in forcing them from him by arms.</p>

<p>6. But cling as such men might to John, they clung
to him rather as mediators than adherents. Their sympathies
went with the demands of the barons when the
delay which had been granted was over and the nobles
again gathered in arms at Brackley in Northamptonshire
to lay their claims before the king. Nothing marks more
strongly the absolutely despotic idea of his sovereignty
which John had formed than the passionate surprise
which breaks out in his reply. "Why do they not ask
for my kingdom?" he cried. "I will never grant such
liberties as will make me a slave!" The imperialist theories
of the lawyers of his father's court had done their
work. Held at bay by the practical sense of Henry, they
had told on the more headstrong nature of his sons.
Richard and John both held with Glanvill that the will
of the prince was the law of the land; and to fetter that
will by the customs and franchises which were embodied
in the baron's claims seemed to John a monstrous usurpation
of his rights.</p>

 <p class="caption2"><i>King John and the Charter.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. But no imperialist theories had touched the minds
of his people. The country rose as one man at his refusal.
At the close of May, London threw open her gates to the
forces of the barons, now arrayed under Robert Fitz Walter
as "Marshal of the Army of God and Holy Church."
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 235]<br />[Pg 236]</a></span>
Exeter and Lincoln followed the example of the capital;
promises of aid came from Scotland and Wales, the northern
barons marched hastily under Eustace de Vesci to
join their comrades in London. Even the nobles who had
as yet clung to the king, but whose hopes of conciliation
were blasted by his obstinacy, yielded at last to the summons
of the "Army of God." Pandulf, indeed, and Archbishop
Langton still remained with John, but they counseled
as Earl Ranulf and William Marshal counseled his
acceptance of the charter. None, in fact, counseled its
rejection save his new justiciar, the Poitevin Peter des
Roches and other foreigners who knew the barons purposed
driving them from the land. But even the number
of these was small; there was a moment when John
found himself with but seven knights at his back and before
him a nation in arms. Quick as he was, he had
been taken utterly by surprise. It was in vain that in
the short respite he had gained from Christmas to Easter,
he had summoned mercenaries to his aid and appealed to
his new suzerain, the Pope. Summons and appeal were
alike too late. Nursing wrath in his heart, John bowed
to necessity, and called the barons to a conference on an
island in the Thames between Windsor and Staines, near
a marshy meadow by the river-side, the meadow of Runnymede.</p>

<p>8. The king encamped on one bank of the river, the
barons covered the flat of Runnymede on the other.
Their delegates met on the 15th of July in the island between
them, but the negotiations were a mere cloak to
cover John's purpose of unconditional submission. The
Great Charter was discussed and agreed to in a single
day.</p>

<h2><i>XLIV.&mdash;AN EARLY ELECTION TO PARLIAMENT.</i></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The following preliminary sketch by J. R. Green, the historian,
serves as an introduction to Palgrave's picture of an election under
Edward I:</p>

<p>"It was Edward the First, who first made laws in what has ever
since been called Parliament. For this purpose he called on the
shires and larger towns to choose men to 'represent' them, or appear
in their stead in the Great Council; the shires sending knights
of the shire, the towns burgesses. These, added to the peers or high
nobles and to the bishops, made up Parliament.</p>

<p>"The business of Parliament was not only to make good laws for
the realm, but to grant money to the king for the needs of the state
in peace and war, and to authorize him to raise this money by taxes
or subsidies from his subjects. So at first people saw little of the
great good of such Parliaments, but dreaded their calling together,
because they brought taxes with them. Nor did men seek, as they
do now, to be chosen members of Parliament, for the way thither
was long and travel costly, and so they did their best not to be
chosen, and when chosen had to be bound over under pain of heavy
fines to serve in Parliament."</p>
</div>

<p>1. During the last half-hour the suitors had been gathering
round the shire-oak awaiting the arrival of the high
officer whose duty it was to preside. Notwithstanding
the size of the meeting, there was an evident system in the
crowd. A considerable proportion of the throng consisted
of little knots of husbandmen or churls, four or five of
whom were generally standing together, each company
seeming to compose a deputation. The churls might be
easily distinguished by their dress, a long frock of coarse
yet snow-white linen hanging down to the same length
before and behind, and ornamented round the neck with
broidery rudely executed in blue thread. They wore, in
fact, the attire of the carter and plowman, a garb which
was common enough in country parts about five-and-twenty
years ago, but which will probably soon be recollected
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
only as an ancient costume, cast away with all the
other obsolete characteristics of merry old England.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
    <a name="p238-illus.jpg" id="p238-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p238-illus.jpg" width="500" height="608" alt="An election procession" title="" />
 <p class="caption2"><i>An Early Election to Parliament.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. These groups of peasantry were the representatives
of their respective townships, the rural communes into
which the whole realm was divided; and each had a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
species of chieftain or head-man in the person of an individual
who, though it was evident that he belonged to the
same rank in society, gave directions to the rest. Interspersed
among the churls, though not confounded with
them, were also very many well-clad persons, possessing
an appearance of rustic respectability, who were also subjected
to some kind of organization, being collected into
sets of twelve men each, who were busily employed in
confabulation among themselves. These were "the sworn
centenary deputies" or jurors, the sworn men who answered
for or represented the several hundreds.</p>

<p>3. A third class of members of the shire court could
be equally distinguished, proudly known by their gilt
spurs and blazoned tabards as the provincial knighthood,
and who, though thus honored, appeared to mix freely
and affably in converse with the rest of the commons of
the shire.</p>

<p>4. A flourish of trumpets announced the approach of
the high-sheriff, Sir Giles de Argentein, surrounded by
his escort of javelin-men, tall yeomen, all arrayed in a
uniform suit of livery, and accompanied, among others,
by four knights, the coroners, who took cognizance of all
pleas that concerned the king's rights within the county,
and who, though they yielded precedence to the sheriff,
were evidently considered to be almost of equal importance
with him. "My masters," said the sheriff to the
assembled crowd, "even now hath the port-joye<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> of the
chancery delivered to me certain most important writs of
our sovereign lord the king, containing his Grace's high
commands." At this time the chancellor, who might be
designated as principal secretary of state for all departments,
was the great medium of communication between
king and subject: whatever the sovereign had to ask or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
tell was usually asked or told by, or under, the directions
of this high functionary.</p>

<p>5. Now, although the gracious declarations which the
chancellor was charged to deliver were much diversified
in their form, yet, somehow or other, they all conveyed
the same intent. Whether directing the preservation of
peace or preparing for the prosecution of a war, whether
announcing a royal birth or a royal death, the knighthood
of the king's son or the marriage of the king's daughter,
the mandates of our ancient kings invariably conclude
with a request or a demand for money's worth or money.</p>

<p>6. The present instance offered no exception to the
general rule. King Edward, greeting his loving subjects,
expatiated upon the miseries which the realm was likely
to sustain by the invasion of the wicked, barbarous, and
perfidious Scots. Church and state, he alleged, were in
equal danger, and "inasmuch as that which concerneth all
ought to be determined by the advice of all concerned,
we have determined," continued the writ, "to hold our
Parliament at Westminster in eight days from the feast
of St. Hilary." The effect of the announcement was
magical. Parliament! Even before the second syllable
of the word had been uttered, visions of aids and subsidies
rose before the appalled multitude, grim shadows of assessors
and collectors floated in the ambient air.</p>

<p>7. Sir Gilbert Hastings instinctively plucked his purse
out of his sleeve; drawing the strings together, he twisted,
and tied them in the course of half a minute of nervous
agitation into a Gordian knot, which apparently defied any
attempt to undo it, except by means practiced by the son
of Ammon. The Abbot of Oseney forthwith guided his
steed to the right about, and rode away from the meeting
as fast as his horse could trot, turning the deafest of
all deaf ears to the monitions which he received to stay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
    8. The sheriff and the other functionaries alone preserved
a tranquil but not a cheerful gravity, as Sir Giles
commanded his clerk to read the whole of the writ, by
which he was commanded "to cause two knights to be
elected for the shire; and from every city within his
bailiwick two citizens; and from every borough two burgesses&mdash;all
of them of the more discreet and wiser sort;
and to cause them to come before the king in this Parliament
at the before-mentioned day and place, with full
powers from their respective communities to perform and
consent to such matters as by common counsel shall then
and there be ordained; and this you will in no wise omit,
as you will answer at your peril."</p>

<p>9. A momentary pause ensued. The main body of
the suitors retreated from the high-sheriff, as though he
had been a center of repulsion. After a short but vehement
conversation among themselves, one of the bettermost
sort of yeomen, a gentleman farmer, if we may use the
modern term, stepped forward and addressed Sir Giles:
"Your worship well knows that we, your commons, are
not bound to proceed to the election. You have no right
to call upon us to interfere. So many of the earls and
barons of the shire, the great men, who ought to take the
main trouble, burthen, and business of the choice of the
knights upon themselves, are absent now in the king's
service, that we neither can nor dare proceed to nominate
those who are to represent the county. Such slender folks
as we have no concern in these weighty matters. How
can we tell who are best qualified to serve?"</p>

<p>10. "What of that, John Trafford?" said the sheriff.
"Do you think that his Grace will allow his affairs to
be delayed by excuses such as these? You suitors of
the shire are as much bound and obliged to concur in
the choice of the county members as any baron of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
realm. Do your duty; I command you in the king's
name!"</p>

<p>11. John Trafford had no help. Like a wise debater,
he yielded to the pinch of the argument without confessing
that he felt it; and, having muttered a few words to
the sheriff, which might be considered as an assent, a long
conference took place between him and some of his brother
stewards, as well as with other suitors. During this confabulation
several nods and winks of intelligence passed
between Trafford and a well-mounted knight; and while
the former appeared to be settling the business with the
suitors, the latter, who had been close to Sir Giles, continued
gradually backing and sidling away through the
groups of shiresmen, and, just as he had got clear out of
the ring, John Trafford declared, in a most sonorous voice,
that the suitors had chosen Sir Richard de Pogeys as one
of their representatives.</p>

<p>12. The sheriff, who, keeping his eye fixed upon Sir
Richard as he receded, had evidently suspected some
man&oelig;uvre, instantly ordered his bailiffs to secure the
body of the member. "And," continued he with much
vehemence, "Sir Richard must be forthwith committed
to custody, unless he gives good bail&mdash;two substantial
freeholders&mdash;that he will duly attend in his place among
the commons on the first day of the session, according to
the law and usage of Parliament."</p>

<p>13. All this, however, was more easily said than done.
Before the verbal precept had proceeded from the lips of
the sheriff, Sir Richard was galloping away at full speed
across the fields. Off dashed the bailiffs after the member,
amid the shouts of the surrounding crowd, who forgot
all their grievances in the stimulus of the chase, which
they contemplated with the perfect certainty of receiving
some satisfaction by its termination; whether by the escape
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
of the fugitive, in which case their common enemy,
the sheriff, would be liable to a heavy amercement;<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> or
by the capture of the knight, a result which would give
them almost equal delight, by imposing a disagreeable
and irksome duty upon an individual who was universally
disliked, in consequence of his overbearing harshness and
domestic tyranny.</p>

<p>14. One of the two above-mentioned gratifications
might be considered as certain. But, besides these, there
was a third contingent amusement, by no means to be
overlooked, namely, the chance that in the contest those
respectable and intelligent functionaries, the sheriff's
bailiffs, might somehow or another come to some kind of
harm. In this charitable expectation the good men of the
shire were not entirely disappointed. Bounding along
the open fields, while the welkin resounded with the
cheers of the spectators, the fleet courser of Sir Richard
sliddered on the grass, then stumbled and fell down the
sloping side of one of the many ancient British intrenchments
by which the plain was crossed, and, horse and
rider rolling over, the latter was deposited quite at the
bottom of the foss, unhurt, but much discomposed.</p>

<p>15. Horse and rider were immediately on their respective
legs again: the horse shook himself, snorted, and
was quite ready to start; but Sir Richard had to regird
his sword, and before he could remount, the bailiffs were
close at him. Dick-o'-the-Gyves attempted to trip him
up, John Catchpole seized him by the collar of his pourpoint.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
A scuffle ensued, during which the nags of the
bailiffs slyly took the opportunity of emancipating themselves
from control. Distinctly seen from the moot-hill,
the strife began and ended in a moment; in what manner
it had ended was declared without any further explanation,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
when the officers rejoined the assembly, by Dick's
limping gait and the closed eye of his companion.</p>

<p>16. In the mean time Sir Richard had wholly disappeared,
and the special return made by the sheriff to the
writ, which I translate from the original, will best elucidate
the bearing of the transaction:</p>

<p>"Sir Richard de Pogeys, knight, duly elected by the
shire, refused to find bail for his appearance in Parliament
at the day and place within mentioned, and having grievously
assaulted my bailiffs in contempt of the king, his
crown, and dignity, and absconded to the Chiltern Hundreds<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>,
into which liberty, not being shire-land or guildable,
I can not enter, I am unable to make any other execution
of the writ as far as he is concerned."</p>

<p>17. At the present day a nominal stewardship connected
with the Chiltern Hundreds, called an office of
profit under the crown, enables the member, by a species
of juggle, to resign his seat. But it is not generally
known that this ancient domain, which now affords the
means of retreating out of the House of Commons, was in
the fourteenth century employed as a sanctuary in which
the knight of the shire took refuge in order to avoid being
dragged into Parliament against his will. Being a
distinct jurisdiction, in which the sheriff had no control,
and where he could not capture the county member, it
enabled the recusant to baffle the process, at least until
the short session had closed.</p>

<h2><i>XLV.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF CRESSY.</i></h2>

<p>1. Froissart was a brilliant historian of the middle
ages. His writings are in quaint old French. At the
request of Henry VIII of England, a translation of his
"Battle of Cressy" was made into the English of that day.
We insert this as a most lively description of the battle
itself, and as a specimen of old literature in which pupils
can not fail to take great interest:</p>

<p>2. Thenglysshmen who were in three batayls, lyeing
on the grounde to rest them, assone as they saw the
frenchmen approche, they rose upon their fete, fayre and
easily, without any haste, and arranged their batayls: the
first, which was the prince's batell, the archers then strode
in the manner of a harrow, and the men at armes in the
botome of the batayle.</p>

<p>3. Therle of North&#257;pton and therle of Arundell,
with the second batell, were on a wyng in good order,
redy to comfort the princes batayle, if nede were. The
lordes and knyghtes of France, c&#257;e not to the assemble
togyder in good order, for some came before, and some
c&#257;e after, in such haste and yvell order, y<sup>t</sup> one of th&#275; dyd
trouble another: when the french kyng sawe the englysshmen,
his blode chaunged, and sayde to his marshals, make
the genowayes go on before, and begynne the batayle in
the name of god and saynt Denyse; ther were of the
genowayse crosbowes, about a fiftene thousand, but they
were so wery of goyng a fote that day, a six leages,
armed with their crosbowes, that they sayde to their constables,
we be not well ordered to fyght this day, for we
be not in the case to do any great dede of armes, we have
more nede of rest. These wordes came to the erle of
Alanson, who sayd, a man is well at ease to be charged
w<sup>t</sup> suche a sorte of rascalles, to be faynt and fayle now at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
moost nede. Also the same season there fell a great
rayne, and a clyps, with a terryble thunder, and before
the rayne, ther came fleying over both batayls, a great
nombre of crowes, for feare of the tempest comynge.</p>

<p>4. Than anone the eyre beganne to wax clere, and the
sonne to shyne fayre and bright, the which was right in
the frenchmens eyen and on thenglysshmens backes.
Whan the genowayes were assembled to-guyder, and began
to aproche, they made a great leape and crye, to
abasshe thenglysshmen, but they stode styll, and styredde
not for all that; th&#257;ns the genowayes agayne the seconde
tyme made another leape, and a fell crye, and stepped forward
a lytell, and thenglysshmen remeued not one fote;
thirdly agayne they leapt and cryed, and went forthe tyll
they come within shotte; thane they shotte feersly with
their crosbowes; thun thenglysshe archers stept forthe
one pase, and lette fly their arowes so hotly, and so thycke,
that it semed snowe; when the genowayes felte the
arowes persynge through heeds, armes, and brestes, many
of them cast downe their crosbowes, and dyde cutte their
strynges, and retourned dysconfited.</p>

<p>5. Whun the frenche kynge sawe them flye away, he
sayd, slee these rascalles, for they shall lette and trouble
us without reason: then ye shulde have sene the men of
armes dasshe in among them, and kylled a great nombre
of them; and ever styll the englysshmen shot where as
they sawe thyckest preace; the sharpe arowes ranne into
the men of armes, and into their horses, and many fell,
horse and men, am&#333;ge the genowayes; and when they
were downe, they coude not relyve agayne, the preace
was so thycke, that one overthrewe another. And also
amonge the englysshmen there were certayne rascalles
that went a fote, with great knyves, and they went in
among the men of armes, and slewe and murdredde many
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
as they lay on the grounde, both erles, baronnes, knyghtes
and squyers, whereof the kynge of Englande was after
dyspleased, for he had rather they had bene taken prisoners.</p>

<p>6. The valyant kyng of Behaygne, called Charles of
Luzenbomge, sonne to the noble emperour Henry of
Luzenbomge, for all that he was nyghe blynde, whun he
understode the order of the batayle, he sayde to them
about hym, where is the lorde Charles my son? his men
sayde, sir, we can not tell, we thynke he be fyghtynge;
thun he sayde, sirs, ye ar my men, my companyons, and
frendes in this journey. I requyre you bring me so farre
forwarde, that I may stryke one stroke with my swerde;
they sayde they wolde do his commandement, and to the
intent that they shulde not lese him in the prease, they
tyed all their raynes of their bridelles eche to other, and
sette the kynge before to accomplysshe his desyre, and so
thei went on their ennemyes; the lorde Charles of Behaygne,
his sonne, who wrote hymselfe kyng of Behaygne,
and bare the armes, he came in good order to the batayle,
but wh&#257;ne he sawe that the matter went awrie on their
partie, he departed, I can not tell you whiche waye, the
kynge his father was so farre forwarde that he strake a
stroke with his swerde, ye and mo thun foure, and fought
valyuntly, and so dyde his compuny, and they adv&#275;tured
themselfe so forwarde, that they were ther all slayne, and
the next day they were founde in the place about the
kyng, and all their horses tyed eche to other.</p>

<p>7. The erle of Alansone came to the batayle right ordy
notlye, and fought with thenglysshmen; and the erle of
Flaunders also on his parte; these two lordes with their
c&#333;panyes wosted the englysshe archers, and came to the
princes batayle, and there fought valyantly longe. The
frenche kynge wolde fayne have come thyder whanne he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
saw their baners, but there was a great hedge of archers
before hym. The same day the frenche kynge hadde
gyven a great blacke courser to Sir John of Heynault,
and he made the lorde Johan of Fussels to ryde on hym,
and to bere his banerre; the same horse tooke the bridell
in the tethe, and brought hym through all the currours of
th&#275;'glysshmen, and as he wolde have retourned agayne, he
fell in a great dyke, and was sore hurt, and had been ther
deed, and his page had not ben, who followed him through
all the batayls, and sawe where his maister lay in the dyke,
and had none other lette but for his horse, for thenglysshmen
wolde not yssue out of their batayle, for takyng of
any prisiner; th&#257;ne the page alyghted and relyved his
maister, thun he went not backe agayn y<sup>e</sup> same way that
they came, there was to many in his way.</p>

<p>8. This batyle bytwene Broy and Cressy, this Saturday
was right cruell and fell, and many a feat of armes
done, that came not to my knowledge; in the night, dyverse
knyghtes and sqyers lost their maisters, and sometyme
came on thenglysshmen, who receyved them in such
wyse, that they were ever nighe slayne; for there was
none taken to mercy nor to raunsome, for so thenglysshmen
were determyned: in the mornyng the day of the batayle,
certayne frenchmen and almaygnes perforce opyned
the archers of the princes batayle, and came and fought
with the men of armes hande to hande: than the seconde
batayle of thenglysshmen came to sucour the princes batayle,
the whiche was tyme, for they had as th&#257;n moche ado;
and they with y<sup>e</sup> prince sent a messanger to the kynge,
who was on a lytell wyndmyll hyll; thun the knyght sayd
to the kyng, sir, therle of Warwyke, and therle of C&#257;fort,
Sir Reynolde Cobham, and other, suche as be about the
prince your sonne, as feersly fought with all, and ar sore
handled, wherefore they desyre you, that you and your batayle
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
wolle come and ayde them, for if the frenchmen encrease,
as they dout they woll, your sonne and they shall
have much ado.</p>

<p>9. Thun the kynge sayde, is my sonne deed or hurt,
or on the yerthe felled? no sir, quoth the knyght, but he
is hardely matched, wherefore he hath nede of your ayde.
Well, sayde the king, returne to him, and to thrm that
sent you hyther, and say to them, that they sende no more
to me for an adventure that falleth, as long as my son is
alyve, and also say to th&#275;, that they suffre hym this day
to wynne his spurres, for if god he pleased, I woll this
journey be his, and the honoure therof, and to them that
be aboute him. Thun the knyght returned agayn to th&#275;,
and shewed the kynges wordes, the which gretly encouraged
them, and repoyned in that they had sende to
the kynge as they dyd. Sir Godfray of Harecourt, wolde
gladly that the erle of Harcourt, his brother, myghte have
been saved, for he hurd say by th&#275; that he sawe his baner,
howe that he was ther in the felde on the french partie,
but Sir Godfray coude not come to hym betymes for he
was slayne or he coude co&#275; at hym, and so also was therle
of Almare, his nephue.</p>

<p>10. In another place the erle of Aleuson, and therle
of Flaunders, fought valyantly, every lorde under his owne
banere; but finally they coude not resyst agaynt the
payssance of thenglysshmen, and so ther they were also
slayne, and dyvers knyghtes and sqyers, also therle of
Lewes of Bloyes, nephue to the frenche kyng, and the
duke of Lorayne, fought under their baners, but at last
they were closed in among a c&#333;pany of englysshmen and
welshmen, and were there slayed, for all their powers.
Also there was slayne the erle of Ausser, therle of Saynt
Poule, and many others.</p>

<p>11. In the evenynge, the frenche kynge, who had lefte
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
about hym no more than a threscore persons, one and
other, whereof Sir John of Heynalt was one, who had
remounted ones the kynge, for his horse was slayne with
an arowe, th&#257; sayde to the kynge, sir, departe hense, for
it is tyme, lese not yourselfe wylfully, if ye have losse at
this tyme, ye shall recover it agaynt another season, and
soo he took the kynge's horse by the brydell, and ledde
hym away in a maner perforce; than the kyng rode tyll
he came to the castell of Broy. The gate was closed, because
it was by that tyme darke; than the kynge called
the captayne, who came to the walles, and sayd, Who is
that calleth there this tyme of night? than the kynge
sayde, open your gate quickly, for this is the fortune of
Fraunce; the captayne knewe than it was the kyng, and
opyned the gate, and let downe the bridge; than the
kyng entred, and he had with hym but fyve baronnes,
Sir Johan of Heynault, Sir Charles of Monmorency, the
lorde of Beaureive, the lorde Dobegny, and the lorde of
Mountfort; the kynge wolde not tary there, but dr&#257;ke
and departed thense about mydnyght, and so rode by
suche guydes as knewe the country, tyll he came in the
mornynge to Anyeuse, and then he rested. This saturday
the englysshmen never departed for their batayls for
chasynge of any man, but kept styll their felde, and ever
defended themselfe agaynst all such as came to assayle
them; the batayle ended about evynsonge tyme.</p>
